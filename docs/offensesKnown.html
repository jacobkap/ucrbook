<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 3</span> Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest<a href="offensesKnown.html#offensesKnown" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h1>
<p>The Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest dataset - often called Return A, “Offenses Known” or, less commonly, OKCA - is the oldest and most commonly used dataset and measures crimes reported to the police. For this reason it is used as <em>the</em> main measure of crime in the United States, and I tend to call it the “crimes dataset.” This data answers the most basic questions about crimes: how many occurred? If you see crime data referenced in a news or academic article it is usually this data. This data also includes the number of crimes solved (though with a weaker definition of “solved” than you may think) and the number of crimes in which the agency concluded did not actually occur which they call an “unfounded” crime.</p>
<p>The Offenses Known data has been <strong>the</strong> crime data of record for nearly a century, and will likely still be for the next couple of decades at least. And that’s due to its simplicity. This data is (with some exceptions we’ll get into) just the monthly number of crimes reported or otherwise known (e.g. discovered while on patrol) to a police agency for a small number of crimes. If you want to know, for example, how many murders or burglaries happened in your cite last year, this is the dataset to turn to. This simplicity allows a much wider group of people to use the data; since it is monthly counts of crimes (with no breakdown by location, race, age, injury, etc.) you don’t need much programming or analytic skills to use it.</p>
<p>I argued earlier in this book that NIBRS is a far superior dataset than anything in SRS, and I stand by that. NIBRS is superior in nearly every way. But for most people - the general public, reporters, many academics, etc. - what is important is ease of use and very basic descriptive statistics such as how many crimes happened in my city last year<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a>, and is it getting more dangerous than it used to be? The Offenses Known data answers that, at least to a point. You can answer more complex questions using NIBRS but most people don’t need those questions answered. They’re content with what can be answered using the Offenses Known data. And for good reason. “Is crime increasing in my city” is really the first and most important question about crime that people have.</p>
<p>Part of the superiority of NIBRS is that while it can answer much more complex questions than SRS datasets, it can also answer the same questions that the SRS can. That’s people, by design, NIBRS collects the same information as SRS and can be converted to SRS data. Many agencies that submit NIBRS data don’t submit SRS data at all, and the FBI converts the NIBRS data to its SRS counterpart for release to the public. This is an almost perfect comparison but not all of the same variables are collected, which will cause some issues that we’ll discuss in this chapter.</p>
<p>One thing you may have heard about this data is that it uses something called the Hierarchy Rule. Basically the rule says that when an incident involves more than one crime, such as a robbery and a murder, you only count the most serious crime. And most serious is based on the hierarchy the FBI has created. This is true and therefore the number of crimes - other than murder which is the most serious - recorded in this data is always an undercount. But you really shouldn’t be too concerned about this. As we’ll get into below, the Hierarchy Rule affects only a relatively small share of incidents so doesn’t undercount crime by too much - and when it does it is primarily undercounting property crime.</p>
<div id="indexCrimesOffensesKnown" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="3.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Which crimes are included?<a href="offensesKnown.html#indexCrimesOffensesKnown" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>This dataset contains information on the number of “Index Crimes” (sometimes called Part I crimes) reported to each agency.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> These index crimes are a collection of eight crimes that, for historical reasons based largely by perceived importance and reliable of their reporting in the 1920s when the UCR program was first developed, are used as the primary measure of crime today. Other data sets in the UCR, such as the Arrests by Age, Sex, and Race data and the Hate Crime data have more crimes reported.</p>
<p>The crimes are, in order by the Hierarchy Rule (which we’ll discuss next):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

<p>Arson is considered an index crime but is not reported in this data - you need to use the separate Arson dataset of the UCR to get access to arson counts. See Chapter <a href="arsonChapter.html#arsonChapter">8</a> for an overview of the Arson data. The ninth crime on that list, simple assault, is not considered an index crime but is nevertheless included in this data.</p>
<p>Each of the crimes in the list above, and their subcategories, are included in the UCR data. In most news and academic articles, however, you’ll see them reported as the total number of index crimes, summing up categories 1-7 and reporting that as “crime.”<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> These index crimes are often divided into violent index crimes - murder, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault - and property index crimes - burglary, theft, motor vehicle theft. For more on index crimes, and the drawbacks of using them, please see Section <a href="SRSGeneral.html#indexCrimes">2.1.3</a>.</p>
<div id="hierarchy" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="3.1.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.1</span> Hierarchy Rule<a href="offensesKnown.html#hierarchy" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>This dataset uses what is called the Hierarchy Rule where only the most serious crime in an incident is reported (except for motor vehicle theft and arson, which are always included).<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> For example if there is an incident where the victim is robbed and then murdered, only the murder is counted as it is considered more serious than the robbery. That the data uses the Hierarchy Rule is an oft-cited (by academics, reporters, random people on Twitter) criticism of the data that is, in my opinion, overblown.</p>
<p>In practice, the Hierarchy Rule has only modest effects on the data, undercounting few crimes. Though the Hierarchy Rule does mean this data is an undercount, data from other sources indicate that it isn’t much of an under count. NIBRS data contains every crime that occurs in an incident (i.e. it doesn’t use the Hierarchy Rule). Using this we can measure how many crimes the Hierarchy Rule excludes. In approximately 90% of incidents, only one crime is committed.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Additionally, when people talk about “crime” they usually mean murder which, while incomplete to discuss crime, means the UCR data here is accurate on that measure.</p>
<p>The FBI released a report <a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/nibrs/2014/resource-pages/effects_of_nibrs_on_crime_statistics_final.pdf">available here</a> in 2015 that directly examined this issue by taking NIBRS data from 2014 and examined how NIBRS data (which doesn’t use the Hierarchy Rule) compares to using the Hierarchy Rule and keeping only the most serious crime. Figure <a href="offensesKnown.html#fig:fbiHierarchy">3.1</a> is a screenshot from their report showing the percent increases in crimes when including all crimes in an incident relative to following the Hierarchy Rule. They find that 10.6% of incidents have multiple crimes occurring. For violent crime, murder and rape have no change; for the remaining violent crimes - robbery and aggravated assault - crimes increased by 0.6%.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Burglary increased by 1% and the largest increases came from theft and motor vehicle theft, increasing by 2.6% and 2.7%, respectively. Curiously, motor vehicle theft increased even though the FBI’s documentation for this data says that it is exempt from the Hierarchy Rule and should always be reported. This suggests either non-compliance or that the manual is incorrect.</p>

</div>
<p>In Table <a href="offensesKnown.html#tab:nibrsHierarchy">3.1</a> I replicate the FBI’s table using NIBRS 2022 data. Results are fairly close. Homicide and rape and unchanged; robbery and aggravated assault both increase by &lt;1%; my count for theft and burglary are a bit smaller, and motor vehicle theft is almost triple the FBI’s 2014 number. But these numbers are mostly consistent - particularly so for violent crime - and I expect the differences are just that 2014 and 2022 data are different. So using the Hierarchy Rule does undercount crime, but this is a small undercounting and is primarily led by property crime. Violent crime is only slightly undercounted. And compared to the number of crimes not counted because the victim doesn’t reports it to the police, this is a very small share of crimes.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Agencies reporting<a href="offensesKnown.html#agencies-reporting" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Figure <a href="offensesKnown.html#fig:offensesAgenciesReporting">3.2</a> shows the annual number of police agencies that reported at least one month that year. With data starting in 1960, there were a little under 7,500 agencies reporting a year until 1970 when the number of agencies began increasing. This continued until the late 1970s when about 14,000 agencies reported, and this remained steady for over a decade before declining in the 1990s until about 12,500 in the latter half of the decade. Then the number of agencies reporting increased steadily until about 16,500 agencies reported in 2010. The number of agencies has slowly increased since then, adding a few hundred agencies from 2010 to 2020. The drop and then partial recovery you see in 2021 and 2022 is from the FBI stopping collection of this data and then restarting that collection in 2021. Most agencies report to NIBRS but the only that still report SRS, and therefore couldn’t report in 2021, caused the drop.</p>
<p>There are actually two lines throughout this entire figure, though they are nearly identical until 2018. That is because there are two ways of measuring how many months an agency reports data. The primary one - and the one the FBI itself uses - is through a variable in the data called the “last_month_reported.” This is, as it sounds, the last month the agency sent data in. So if an agency reports data in December the variable will have “December” as the last month. If that agency only reported it December the variable will still say “December.” Most people use this as the number of months that the agency reported. So a December value is 12 months reported, even though in our example it was the only month with data.</p>
<p>In the data there are 12 columns - one for each month - that says whether the agency reported data in that month. That’s what I use in the green line to measure how many months of data that agency reported. I refer to this in the figure and in the data I have released as the “number of months missing.” When looking at agencies reporting only a single month the lines are nearly identical, though the last month reported measure is nearly always larger. This changes in 2018 as a result of the data changing, meaning I needed to use different columns to check starting in that year. That means that post-2018 data may not be comparable to 2018 and earlier using this variable.</p>

<p class="caption">
Figure 3.2: The annual number of agencies reporting at least one month of data, 1960-2022.
</p>
</div>
<p>Usually when you are looking at crime data you want annual data, so having agencies report a full year’s of data is more important than them submitting just partial data. This is especially important when comparing an agency over time or two different agencies to each other. Obviously, an agency with 6 month of data will have fewer crimes reported than one with 12 months reported, all else being equal. But this is something easy to overlook as it’s an easy assumption that agencies will report a full years-worth of data. Unfortunately, this is always true. Some agencies don’t report any data and others report only part of the year - though if an agency reports one month they usually do report all 12. Figure <a href="offensesKnown.html#fig:offensesAgenciesReportingFull">3.3</a> repeats Figure <a href="offensesKnown.html#fig:offensesAgenciesReporting">3.2</a> but now showing only agencies reporting 12 months of data, using both of our measures. Since 1960 every year has had fewer agencies reporting full data using the “number of months missing” method than the “last month reported” method.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span style="display:block;" id="fig:offensesAgenciesReportingFull"></span>
<img src="03_offenses_known_files/figure-html/offensesAgenciesReportingFull-1.png" alt="The annual number of agencies reporting a full year of data, 1960-2022." width="90%" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 3.3: The annual number of agencies reporting a full year of data, 1960-2022.
</p>
</div>
<p>So using the far more common last month reported method will overestimate how many agencies report a full year of data. In practice, though, this affects very little data. At least when aggregating nationally - which I generally advise against since local crime matters a lot more than national averages. Still, let’s look the increase in the total number of crimes reported by 12-month reporting agencies increases from the “number of months missing” measure to the “last month reported” measure. The answer is an extremely small increase, averaging (mean = 0.93, mean = 1.55) about a one percent point increase each year. The differences in measuring how many months are reported can matter a great deal at the agency-level, but does very little when aggregating nationally.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Important variables<a href="offensesKnown.html#important-variables" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Now let’s talk about some important variables in this data such as what it actually measures. For each crime we have four different categories indicating the number of crimes actually committed, the number cleared, and the number determined to not have occurred. Like other UCR data, there are also variables that provide information about the agency - ORI codes, population under jurisdiction - the month and year that the data covers, and how many months reported data.</p>
<div id="actual" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="3.3.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.3.1</span> Actual crimes<a href="offensesKnown.html#actual" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>This is the number of offenses that <em>actually</em> occurred - where <em>actually</em> means that a police investigation found that the crime report was accurate. Occurred is actually a bit of a strong word. These are crimes that come to the police’s attention in that month, even if the crime actually occurred before. For example, if someone walks into a police department on February, 2025 and says “last year I killed five people” that would count as five murders in February, 2025 (that is assuming that the police believe that the person is telling the truth). It would not be counted in 2024 when the person says the murders took place.</p>
<p>Crimes that are reported that the police find did not occur (e.g. report of an arson but turns that the fire began accidentally) are called “unfounded” crimes. So this variable is the one people use to measure <em>crime</em>. For example if 10 people are murdered in a city the number of “actual murders” would be 10. A crime is a crime incident, regardless of how many offenders there were. If there are multiple victims in a case, such as a double murder, then it would count as multiple crimes.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="offensesKnown.html#fig:newarkMurders">3.4</a>, for example, shows the number of murders per 100,000 population in Newark, NJ, for 1960-2022. One things stands out. Or doesn’t stand out, in a bad way. Newark Police didn’t report a full year of data in 2015; they reported only 11 months. It is imperceptible in the figure but if you look at the number of months reported in that year - using either the last month reported or the number of months missing measure - you can see that December is missing. While visualizing the data is often a good way to look for outliers or missingness, it’s not enough alone. You need to look at the raw data as well to be safe.</p>

<p>Since this is the number of crimes reported and found to occurred, it undercounts the total number of reported crimes. To get that number you’ll need to add actual crimes to unfounded crimes, which we discuss in Section @ref({unfounded}). However, unfounded crimes are increasingly not being reported as agencies move to NIBRS reporting which does not capture unfounded crimes.</p>

<div id="clearedCrimes" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="3.3.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.3.2</span> Total cleared crimes<a href="offensesKnown.html#clearedCrimes" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>A crime is cleared when an offender is arrested or when the case is considered cleared by exceptional means. To be more specific, this data counts crime as a crime incident, regardless of the number of offenders. For example, if three people robbed a person, that is one crime of robbery, not three separate crimes. This crime is cleared when one of the three robbers is arrested - no matter the outcome for the other two robbers. Arresting all three still counts as a single robbery cleared. If those three people had robbed two people that would be reported as two robberies. The first year with clearance data is in 1963, though that is extremely rare; the vast majority of agencies started reporting this data in 1964.</p>
<p>Even though this dataset is formally named “Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest” it does include clearances where no one is arrested, which are called “exceptional clearances” or “clearances by exceptional means.” For exceptional clearances, police must have identified the offender, have sufficient evidence to arrest that offender, know where they are (so they can actually be apprehended) and only then be unable to make the arrest. Exceptional clearances include cases where the offender dies before an arrest (by any means, including suicide, accidental, illness, killed by someone including a police officer) or when the police are unable to arrest the person since they are already in custody by another jurisdiction (including out of the country or in custody of another agency) and extradition is denied. Two other potential causes of exceptional clearance are when prosecution of the case cannot go forward because the district attorney refuses to prosecute the case, for reasons other than lack of evidence, or when a victim refuses to assist the prosecution in the case.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this data does not differentiate between clearances by arrest or by exceptional means so there’s no way to determine how many clearances mean the offender is actually arrested - and even more problematic, how many clearances have all of the offenders arrested. NIBRS data does differentiate these types of clearances, another advantage of using it. There is also some evidence that at least some police agencies report classify large numbers of clearances as clearances through exception means (again, we have no way to tell which is which using this data) even though exceptional clearances should be rare given that times where the offender is known but cannot be arrested are likely far less common than when they are arrested. For an investigation into this issue, see the <span class="citation">Yeung et al. (<a href="#ref-yeung2018comes">2018</a>)</span> article available on ProPublica’s website <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/when-it-comes-to-rape-just-because-a-case-is-cleared-does-not-mean-solved">here</a></p>
<p>Clearances are reported in the month that they occur, regardless of when the crime they are clearing occurred. In practice, however, most crimes are cleared in the month that they occur. According to the 2019 NIBRS, it takes on average 7 days between the incident and the arrest (median = 0 days) date when averaging across all crimes - for individual crimes these values will be different. This means that most of the clearances will be for the same month as the initial crime - though this will be less common for crimes that happen at the end of a month. Of course, police agencies can solve older cases - and even target cold cases to be solved - so this is still a degree of uncertainty for which month these clearances are for.</p>
<p>This means that there are occasionally months - and even years - where there are more reported crimes cleared than crimes that occur.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Figure <a href="offensesKnown.html#fig:lapdClearance">3.5</a>, for example, shows the number of actual and cleared murders from the Los Angeles Police Department. In 2013 there were more murders cleared (271) than actual murders (251) In 2020, both values are zero as the LAPD did not report data that year.</p>
<p>This is actually a good check to see when people who use this data don’t actually understand how it works. I’ve seen published academic papers that say that having more clearances than actual crimes is a data error; clearly they declined to read the official manual (or this book) before they, their editor, and their anonymous reviewers published the paper.</p>

<p>This variable is a subset of the Total Cleared variable and only includes clearances for offenses in which <strong>every</strong> offender is younger than age 18. Since this requires that the police know, or at least believe, the age of every offender, it is probably fairly inaccurate. This category includes cases where the juvenile is given a citation to show up in court for their trial and is not formally arrested and taken into custody.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.3.4</span> Unfounded crimes<a href="offensesKnown.html#unfounded" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>An unfounded crime is one in which a police investigation has determined that the reported crime did not actually happen. The first year of data that included unfounded crimes was 1979, though most agencies began reporting in 1983.</p>
<p>For example, I observed during a ride-along a report of a burglary where the homeowners said that they came home, and the front door was open and they thought it might have been their son who forgot to close it but were worried that it could be a burglar, so they called the police just in case. This would be recorded as a burglary and if it turned out to be the son, the police would then record this as an unfounded burglary.</p>
<p>Other unfounded crimes would include when someone reports a crime but later says that the report wasn’t true. For example, a person could report a burglary to the police to collect insurance money on the items they claim was stolen. If the police discover this they would unfound the case - and the lying to the police and fraud would not be counted as neither of those are crimes included in this dataset. The way that the police do this in the data is to record an unfounded crime as a negative actual crime. If there are 10 burglaries already reported and then the above example occurred they would take those 10, add 1 for the report, and then subtract one for when they decide the crime is unfounded. This evens out the data to “erase” the initial report. If the unfounding occurs in a different month than the reported crime then this could lead to negative crimes being reported. This is just another quirk of SRS data and is another good check to see if a person using the data actually understands it as I’ve also seen people say negative crimes is a data error.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="offensesKnown.html#fig:frankenmuthRape">3.6</a> provides one example of this by showing the number of burglaries that the Frankenmuth Police, MI, say actually occurred from 1960-2022. In 1977 they reported -1 burglaries, the result of having more cleared than actual burglaries in that year.</p>

<p>While this is a useful variable, it is not captured in NIBRS data. Instead the number of unfounded crimes is always reported as zero. For example, Figures <a href="offensesKnown.html#fig:memphisUnfounded">3.7</a> and <a href="offensesKnown.html#fig:denverUnfounded">3.8</a> show the annual number of unfounded crimes (of any crime type) in Memphis, TN, and Denver, CO, which are two of the earliest large agencies to adopt NIBRS. Memphis started in reporting to NIBRS in 2000 and Denver did so in 2005. These agencies stopped reporting any unfounded crimes either in that or the following year.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> Important changes<a href="offensesKnown.html#important-changes" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>There are two major changes in recording practices over the life of this dataset: an expansion of what counts as rape, and a reduction in what counts as manslaughter.</p>
<div id="rape-definition-change" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="3.4.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.4.1</span> Rape definition change<a href="offensesKnown.html#rape-definition-change" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The FBI changed the definition of rape for UCR data starting in 2013 to a broader definition than the older definition, which is commonly called the “legacy definition” or “legacy” or “historical” rape. The legacy definition is “the carnal knowledge of a female <strong>forcibly</strong> and against her will” (emphasis added). This means that only rape is only included in UCR data when it is a female (of any age, there is no differentiation for child victims) forcibly vaginally penetrated by a penis. This is a narrow definition and excludes a number of sexual acts that people may consider rape such as forced oral or anal sex, and cases with a male victim.</p>
<p>Starting in 2013, rape has a new, broader definition in the UCR to include oral and anal penetration (by a body part or object) and to allow men to be victims. The new definition is: “Penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim.” The previous definition included only forcible intercourse against a woman. This definition is far broader and is effectively any non-consensual sexual act. It also includes male victims though the data does not differentiate between male or female (or any other gender) victims.</p>
<p>Both the current and legacy definitions exclude statutory rape and incest other than forcible incest.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> They both also include lack of consent as cases where the victim cannot give consent, such as if they are too young or are mentally or physically incapacitated - the FBI specifically give the example of being temporarily incapacitated through drugs or alcohol.</p>
<p>As this revised definition is broader than the original one post-2013, rape data is not comparable to pre-2013 data. 2013, however, is simply the year that the FBI required that agencies report using the new definition. As might not be too surprising, not all agencies followed this requirement. We’ll look at four examples to show when there is clear evidence that the agency did change their definition in 2013, when it’s clear they did so a year later, when it’s unclear exactly when they made the change, and when the agency seems to not follow the change at all.</p>
<p>We’ll start with the Philadelphia Police Department shown in Figure <a href="offensesKnown.html#fig:rapePhilly">3.9</a>. It’s declining slowly but steadily over the 2000-2012 time period until spiking sharply in 2013. Since the rape definition change in 2013 is far broader than previous year’s definition, this makes sense. A broader definition should lead to a sudden increase in reported rapes if the agency is reporting correctly.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>In comparison, New York City has the sudden spike a year later, which indicates that they didn’t start using the new definition until 2014. Figure <a href="offensesKnown.html#fig:rapeNYC">3.10</a> shows that rape is fairly steady, though increasing, in the years leading up to 2013 and has almost no change from 2012 to 2013, but a huge increase in 2014 and then steadily increases from there, spiking again in 2018. This seems like a fairly clear indicator that NYC simply didn’t follow the new definition until 2014.</p>

</div>
<p>Less clear is what’s happening in San Francisco, shown in Figure <a href="offensesKnown.html#fig:rapeLA">3.11</a>. Here we do see an increase in 2013 which while it appears small on the graph is actually a 49% increase from 2012. Then there is a much larger spike in 2014 - a 120% increase - which may suggest that part of the agency started following the new definition in 2013 and the remainder followed in 2014. Or maybe some months used the old definition and others the new definition in 2013, while all of 2014 used the new definition However, increases or decreases are relatively common in San Francisco so it could also be that the agency only switched to the new definition in 2014 and the spike in 2013 is just a coincidence.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Finally, we’ll look at Jackson Police Department in Mississippi where the definition change seems to have had no effect. As seen in Figure <a href="offensesKnown.html#fig:rapeJackson">3.12</a>, reported rapes start to undulate in 2010 with 2013 data perfectly in line with the before and after trends - no sign that there is a change in reporting. This suggests that Jackson simply did not follow the definition change and continues to report using the old definition.</p>

<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>My takeaway from this is that rape should not be used at all for years after 2012. While the definition change makes pre-2013 and 2013+ years non-comparable, the differences in agency responses to this change - i.e. if they follow the rules or not - is such a mess that the data is too flawed to use.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-decline-of-manslaughter" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="3.4.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.4.2</span> The decline of manslaughter<a href="offensesKnown.html#the-decline-of-manslaughter" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>This data contains two different crime subcategories for homicide: “murder and non-negligent manslaughter,” and “manslaughter by negligence.” The first is our measure of murder, and it includes everything we traditionally think of when it comes to murder - shootings, stabbings, strangulation, basically any intentional killing of another person.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Suicides, killing a fetus, and accidental killings (e.g. car crashes) are not considered murders.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> The second, manslaughter by negligence - usually called just “manslaughter” - is when someone kills another person through “gross negligence” but does not kill them intentionally. This can include accidental killings when the death was caused by gross negligence. The FBI provide examples of this as kids playing with guns and shooting each other (and not knowing the gun was loaded) or a hunter accidentally shooting someone while hunting. After the late 1970s this excludes deaths from traffic accidents caused by negligence, such as hit and runs or DUIs. However, prior to this, these deaths were included, which is the cause of the very high number of manslaughters in the 1960s and 1970s.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="offensesKnown.html#fig:manslaughterVsMurder">3.13</a> shows the annual number of murders, manslaughters, and the sum of the two nationwide from 1960-2022. This just sums up the total reported counts from every agency each year so part of the increase is simply due to more agencies reporting as the year gets closer to the present day - so please pay attention to the diverging paths of each crime, not the trend for the individual crime over time. Murder is always more common than manslaughter, but these values are not that far apart in the early decade of data and manslaughter doesn’t become rare until the end of the 1970s.</p>

<p class="caption">
Figure 3.13: The annual number of murder and non-negligent manslaughter, manslaughter by negligence, and the sum of the two, nationwide from 1960-2022.
</p>
</div>
<p>Figure <a href="offensesKnown.html#fig:manslaughterPercent">3.14</a> shows another way to look at this data: manslaughter as a percent of reported murder. In the early years of our data manslaughter was fairly common, with about 70-80% as many manslaughters reported as murders. This declined sharply in the mid-1960s until there were around 45% as many manslaughters as murders in the mid-1970s. Again, this declined until it was about 4% in 1980, and it has remained around there ever since. As police behavior could reduce traffic fatalities - and arrests for DUIs and traffic tickets are designed to improve public safety - it is unfortunate the we no longer have data on traffic deaths.</p>
<p>Manslaughter increased to over 1,000 for the first time since 1978 in 2020, increased against to over 1,700 in 2021 and continued at around that number in 2022. This is possibly related to the increase in murders over the last few years of available data. Unfortunately, this dataset doesn’t allow us to do almost anything at figuring out more information than monthly or annual counts. NIBRS, in comparison, allows us to do this kind of deep dive, and for curious readers NIBRS also has manslaughter so you can investigate this question yourself.</p>
