UCR data is, with the exception of the more detailed data that only covers murders, a monthly number of crimes or arrests reported to a single police agency which is then gathered by the FBI into one file that includes all reporting agencies. It is actually a collection of different datasets, all of which have information about crimes and arrests that occur in a particular jurisdiction. Think of your home town. This data will tell you how many crimes were reported for a small number of crime categories or how many people (broken down by age, sex, and race) were arrested for a (larger) set of crime categories in that city (if the city has multiple police agencies then each agency will report crimes/arrests under their jurisdiction though the largest agency - usually the local police department - will cover the vast majority of crimes/arrests in that city) in a given month. This is a very broad measure of crime, and its uses in research - or uses for understanding crime at all - is fairly limited. Yet is has become over much of the last century - and will likely remain among researchers for at least the next decade - the most important crime data in the United States.1 UCR data is important for three reasons: The definitions are standard, and all agencies (tend to) follow them so you can compare across agencies and over time.2 The data is available since 1960 (for most of the datasets) so there is a long period of available data.3 The data is available for most of the 18,000 police agencies in the United States so you can compare across agencies. More than many other datasets, there will be times when using UCR data that you’ll think “that’s weird”. This book will cover this weirdness and when we think the weirdness is just an odd - but acceptable - quirk of the data, and when it is a sign of a big problem in the data or in that particular variable and that we should avoid using it. For most of this book we’ll be discussing the caveats of the above reasons - or, more directly, why these assumptions are wrong - but these are the reasons why the data is so influential. 1.1 Goal of the book By the end of each chapter you should have a firm grasp on the dataset that is covered and how to use it properly. However, this book can’t possibly cover every potential use case for the data so make sure to carefully examine the data yourself for your own particular use. I get a lot of emails from people asking questions about this data so my own goal is to create a single place that answers as many questions as I can about the data. Again, this is among the most commonly used crime datasets and there are still many current papers published with incorrect information about the data (including such simple aspects like what geographic unit data is in and what time unit it is in). So hopefully this book will decrease the number of misconceptions about this data, increasing overall research quality. Since manuals are boring, I’ll try to include graphs and images to try to alleviate the boredom. That said, I don’t think it’s possible to make it too fun so sorry in advanced. This book is a mix of facts about the data, such as how many years are available, and my opinions about it, such as whether it is reliable. In cases of facts I’ll just say a statement - e.g. “the offenses data is available since 1960”. In cases of opinion I’ll temper the statement by saying something like “in my opinion…” or “I think”. 1.2 Structure of the book This book will be divided into ten chapters: this chapter, an intro chapter briefly summarizing each dataset and going over overall issues with UCR data, and seven chapters each covering one of the seven UCR datasets. The final chapter will cover county-level UCR data, a commonly used but highly flawed aggregation of UCR data that I recommend against using. Each chapter will follow the same format: we’ll start with a brief summary of the data such as when it first because available and how it can be used. Next we’ll look at how many agencies report their data to this dataset, often looking at how to measure this reporting rate a couple of different ways. Finally, we’ll cover the important variables included in the data and how to use them properly (including not using them at all) - this will be the bulk of each chapter. 1.3 Citing this book If this data was useful in your research, please cite it.

First, and probably most commonly used, is the data put together by the National Archive of Criminal Justice Data (NACJD)). This a team out of the University of Michigan who manages a huge number of criminal justice datasets and makes them available to the public. If you have any questions about crime data - UCR or other crime data - I highly recommend you reach out to them for answers. They have a collection of data and excellent documentation available for UCR data available on their site here. One limitation to their data, however, is that each year of data is available as an individual file meaning that you’ll need to concatenate each year together into a single file. Some years also have different column names (generally minor changes like spelling robbery “rob” one year and “robb” the next) which requires more work to standardize before you could concatenate. They also only have data through 2016 which means that the most recent years (UCR data is available through 2019) of data are (as of this writing) unavailable. Next, and most usable for the general public - but limited for researchers - is the FBI’s official website Crime Data Explorer. On this site you can chose an agency and see annual crime data (remember, UCR data is monthly so this isn’t as detailed as it can be) for certain crimes (and not even all the crimes actually available in the data). This is okay for the general public but only provides a fraction of the data available in the actual data so is really not good for researchers. It’s worth mentioning a final source of UCR information. This is the annual Crimes in the United States report released by the FBI each year around the start of October.4 As an example, here is the website for the 2019 report. In this report is summarized data which in most cases estimates missing data and provides information about national and subnational (though rarely city-level) crime data. As with the FBI’s site, it is only a fraction of the true data available so is not a very useful source of crime data for quality research. Still, this is a very common source of information used by researchers. 1.4.1 Where to find the data used in this book The data I am using in this book is the cleaned (we’ll discuss in more detail exactly what I did to clean each dataset in the dataset’s chapter, but the short answer is that I did very little) and concatenated data that I put together from the raw data that the FBI releases. That data is available on my website here. I am hosting this book through GitHub which has a maximum file size allowed that is far smaller than these data, so you’ll need to go to my site to download the data; it’s not available through this book’s GitHub repo. 1.5 Recommended reading While this book is designed to help researchers use this data, the FBI has an excellent manual on this data designed to help police agencies submit their data. That manual, called the “Summary Reporting System (SRS) User Manual” provides excellent definitions and examples of many variables included in the data. In this book when I quote the FBI, such as defining a crime, I quote from this manual. The manual is available to download as a PDF on the FBI’s site and I’ve also posted it on my GitHub page in case the FBI ever take down the PDF.5 The link on my GitHub page is here. I highly recommend that you read this manual before using the data. That manual, alongside this book which tries to explain when and how the agencies don’t follow the manual, will provide a solid foundation for your understanding of UCR data. 1.6 How to contribute to this book If you have any questions, suggestions (such as a topic to cover), or find any issues, please make a post on the Issues page for this book on GitHub. On this page you can create a new issue (which is basically just a post on this forum) with a title and a longer description of your issue. You’ll need a GitHub account to make a post. Posting here lets me track issues and respond to your message or alert you when the issue is closed (i.e. I’ve finished or denied the request). Issues are also public so you can see if someone has already posted something similar. For more minor issues like typos or grammar mistakes, you can edit the book directly through its GitHub page. That’ll make an update for me to accept, which will change the book to include your edit. To do that, click the edit button at the top of the site - the button is highlighted in the below figure. You will need to make a GitHub account to make edits. When you click on that button you’ll be taken to a page that looks like a Word Doc where you can make edits. Make any edits you want and then scroll to the bottom of the page. There you can write a short (please, no more than a sentence or two) description of what you’ve done and then submit the changes for me to review. Figure 1.1: The edit button for how to make edits of this book. Please only use the above two methods to contribute or make suggestions about the book. While it’s a bit more work for you to do it this way, since you’ll need to make a GitHub account if you don’t already have one, it helps me organize all the questions in one place and update the book if I decide to add answers to certain questions. The FBI has said they will no longer accept UCR data after 2020, instead only accepting the more detailed National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) data. However, only about half of agencies reported NIBRS data in 2019 and this number decreases steadily for earlier years. This means that UCR data has the longevity that NIBRS doesn’t have, as most agencies have reported for decades, and will still be useful even though the data becomes increasingly outdated.↩︎ We’ll see many examples of when agencies do not follow the definitions, which really limits this data.↩︎ While the original UCR data first reported in 1929, there is only machine-readable data since 1960.↩︎ They also release a report about the first 6-months of the most recent year of data before the October release but this is generally an estimate from a sample of agencies so is far less useful.↩︎ This is far more likely to happen as a result of standard government changing a site and forgetting to update the link rather than intentionally making the manual unavailable.↩︎ "],["about-the-author.html", "About the Author", " About the Author Jacob Kaplan is a Professional Specialist at the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University.

Answering it seems simple - you just count up all the crimes that happen in an area and see if that number of bigger than it was in previous times. However, putting this into practice invites a number of questions, all of which affect how we measure crime. First, we need to define what a crime is. Not philosophically what actions are crimes - or what should be crimes - but literally which of the many thousands of different criminal acts (crimes as defined by state or federal law) should be considered in this measure. Should murder count? Most people would say yes. How about jaywalking or speeding? Many would say probably not. Should marital rape be considered a crime? Now, certainly most people (all, I would hope) would say yes. But in much of the United States it wasn’t a crime until the 1970s (Bennice and Resick 2003; McMahon-Howard, Clay-Warner, and Renzulli 2009). Next, we have to know what geographic and time unit to measure crimes at since these decisions determine how precise we can measure crime and when it changed. That is, if you are mugged on Jan 1st at exactly 12:15pm right outside your house, how do we record it? Should we be as precise as including the exact time and location (such as your home address)? Out of privacy concerns to the victim, should we only include a larger time unit (such as hour of the day or just the day without any time of day) or a larger geographic unit (such as a Census Tract or the city)? The final question is that when a crime occurs, how do we know? That is, when we want to count how many crimes occurred do we ask people how often they’ve been victimized, do we ask people how often they commit a crime, do we look at crimes reported to police, crimes charged in a criminal court? Each of these measures will likely give different answers as to how many crimes occurred. The FBI answered all of these questions in 1929 when they began the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program Data, or UCR data for short. Crime consists of eight crime categories - murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, motor vehicle theft, theft, and simple assault - that are reported to the police and is collected each month from each agency in the country. So essentially we know how many of a small number of crime categories happen each month in each city (though some cities have multiple police agencies so even this is more complicated than it seems). These decisions, born primarily out of the resource limitations of 1929 (i.e. no computers), have had a major impact on criminology research. The first seven crime categories - known as “Index Crimes” or “Part 1 crimes” (or “Part I” sometimes) - are the ones used to measure crime in many criminology papers, even when the researchers have access to data that covers a broader selection of crimes than these.6 These are also the crimes that the news uses each year to report on how crime in the United States compares to the previous year. The crime data actually also includes the final crime, simple assault, though it is not included as an index crime and is, therefore, generally ignored by researchers - a relatively large flaw in most studies that we’ll discuss in more detail in Section 2.1.3. 2.1 Crimes included in the UCR datasets UCR data covers only a subset - and for the crime data, a very small subset - of all crimes that can occur. It also only includes crimes reported to the police. So there are two levels of abstraction from a crime occurring to it being included in the data: a crime must occur that is one of the crimes included in one of the UCR datasets (we detail all of these crimes below) and the victim must report the incident to the police. While the crimes included are only a small selection of crimes - which were originally chosen since at the time the UCR was designed these were considered important offenses and among the best reported - this is an important first step to understanding the data. UCR data should be understood as a loose collection of data that seeks to understand crimes and arrests in the United States. There are seven datasets in the UCR collection that each cover a different topic or a subset of a previously covered topic: crimes, arrests, property crimes specifically, homicides specifically, police officers killed or assaulted, arson specifically, and hate crimes.7 In this section we’ll go over the crimes included in the two main UCR datasets: Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest and (which I like to call the “crime” dataset) and the Arrests by Age, Sex, and Race (the “arrests” dataset). These are the most commonly used UCR datasets and the stolen property and homicide datasets are simply more detailed subsets of these datasets. The hate crime dataset can cover a broader selection of offenses than in the crimes or arrests data, so we’ll discuss those in the hate crimes chapter. 2.1.1 Crimes in the Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest dataset As mentioned above - and as most criminology papers will tell you - the crimes included in the UCR’s Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest data are the seven index crimes (eight when including arson, though arson is only reported in its own dataset so is usually excluded) - homicide, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, theft, and motor vehicle theft - as well as simple assault. This is true but incomplete. The data also includes subcategories for all crimes other than simple assault and theft - though theft has its own UCR dataset which goes into detail about the thefts. Both robbery and aggravated assault, for example, have subcategories showing which weapon the offender used (if any) during the crime. This allows for a more detailed understanding of the crime than looking only at the broad category. I’m not sure why most research includes only the broader categories and doesn’t tend to look at subcategories, but that seems to be the case in most studies that I have read. Some police agencies only report the broader categories and don’t report subcategories, but most report subcategories so this is an under-exploited source of data. Homicide Murder and non-negligent manslaughter Manslaughter by negligence Rape Completed rape Attempted rape Robbery With a firearm With a knife of cutting instrument With a dangerous weapon not otherwise specified Unarmed - using hands, fists, feet, etc. Aggravated Assault (assault with a weapon or with the intent to cause serious bodily injury) With a firearm With a knife of cutting instrument With a dangerous weapon not otherwise specified Unarmed - using hands, fists, feet, etc. Burglary With forcible entry Without forcible entry Attempted burglary with forcible entry Theft (other than of a motor vehicle) Motor vehicle theft Theft of a car Theft of a truck or bus Theft of an other type of vehicle Simple Assault 2.1.2 Crimes in the Arrests by Age, Sex, and Race dataset The crimes included in the Arrests by Age, Sex, and Race - the “arrest” data tells you how many people were arrested for a particular crime category - are different than those in the crime data. The arrest data covers a wider variety of crimes, including drug and alcohol crimes, gambling, and fraud. However, it is also less detailed than the crime dataset when it comes to violent crime. While it covers the same broad categories of violent crimes as the crimes data - murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, and simple assault - it doesn’t include the more detailed breakdown that is available in the crime data. For example, in the crime data robbery is included as well as the subcategories of robbery with a gun, robbery with a knife, robbery with another dangerous weapon, and robbery without a weapon. In comparison, the arrest data only includes robbery without any subcategories. Homicide Murder and non-negligent manslaughter Manslaughter by negligence Rape Robbery Aggravated assault Burglary Theft (other than of a motor vehicle) Motor vehicle theft Simple assault Arson Forgery and counterfeiting Fraud Embezzlement Stolen property - buying, receiving, and possessing Vandalism Weapons offenses - carrying, possessing, etc. Prostitution and commercialized vice Sex offenses - other than rape or prostitution Drug abuse violations - total Drug sale or manufacturing Opium and cocaine, and their derivatives (including morphine and heroin) Marijuana Synthetic narcotics Other dangerous non-narcotic drugs Drug possession Opium and cocaine, and their derivatives (including morphine and heroin) Marijuana Synthetic narcotics Other dangerous non-narcotic drugs Gambling - total Bookmaking - horse and sports Number and lottery All other gambling Offenses against family and children - nonviolent acts against family members. Includes neglect or abuse, nonpayment of child support or alimony. Driving under the influence (DUI) Liquor law violations - Includes illegal production, possession (e.g. underage) or sale of alcohol, open container, or public use laws. Does not include DUIs and drunkenness. Drunkenness - i.e. public intoxication Disorderly conduct Vagrancy - includes begging, loitering (for adults only), homelessness, and being a “suspicious person.” All other offenses (other than traffic) - a catch-all category for any arrest that is not otherwise specified in this list. Does not include traffic offenses. Very wide variety of crimes are included - use caution when using! Suspicion - “Arrested for no specific offense and released without formal charges being placed.” Curfew and loitering law violations - for minors only. Runaways - for minors only. 2.1.3 What is an index (or part 1) crime? One of the first (and seemingly only) thing that people tend to learn about UCR crime data is that it covers something called an “index crime.”8 Index crimes, sometimes written as Part 1 or Part I crimes, are the seven crimes originally chosen by the FBI to be included in their measure of crimes as these offenses were both considered serious and generally well-reported so would be a useful measure of crime. Index crimes are often broken down into property index crimes - burglary, theft, and motor vehicle theft (and arson now, though that’s often not included and is reported less often by agencies) - and violent index crimes (murder, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault). The “index” is simply that all of the crimes are summed up into a total count of crimes (violent, property, or total) for that police agency. The biggest problem with index crimes is that it is simply the sum of 8 (or 7 since arson data usually isn’t included) crimes. Index crimes have a huge range in their seriousness - it includes, for example, both murder and theft - so summing up the crimes gives each crime equal weight. This is clearly wrong as 100 murders is more serious than 100 thefts. This is especially a problem as less serious crimes (theft mostly) are far more common than more serious crimes. In 2017, for example, there were 1.25 million violent index crimes in the United States. That same year had 5.5 million thefts. So using index crimes as your measure of crimes fails to account for the seriousness of crimes. Looking at total index crimes is, in effect, mostly just looking at theft. Looking at violent index crimes alone mostly measures aggravated assault. This is especially a problem because it hides trends in violent crimes. As an example, San Francisco, shown in Figure 2.1, has had a huge increase - about 50% - in index crimes in the last several years. When looking closer, that increase is driven almost entirely by the near doubling of theft since 2011. During the same years, index violent crimes have stayed fairly steady. So the city isn’t getting more dangerous - at least not in terms of violent index crimes increasing - but it appears like it is due to just looking at total index crimes. Figure 2.1: Thefts and total index crimes in San Francisco, 2000-2022. Many researchers divide index crimes into violent and nonviolent categories, which helps but even this isn’t entirely sufficient. Take Chicago as an example. It is a city infamous for its large number of murders. But as a fraction of index crimes, Chicago has a rounding error worth of murders. Their 653 murders in 2017 is only 0.5% of total index crimes. For violent index crimes, murder made up 2.2% of crimes that year. As seen in Figure 2.2, in no year where data is available did murders account for more than 3.5% of violent index crimes; and, while murders are increasing as a percent of violent index crimes they still account for no more than 2.5% in most recent years. What this means is that changes in murder are very difficult to detect. If Chicago had no murders this year, but a less serious crime (such as theft) increased slightly, we couldn’t tell from looking at the number of index crimes, even from violent index crimes. As discussed in the below section, using this sample of crimes as the primary measure of crimes - and particularly of violent crimes - is also misleading as it excludes important - and highly common relative to index crimes - offenses, such as simple assault. Figure 2.2: Murders in Chicago as a percent of violent index crimes, 1960-2022. 2.1.3.1 What is a violent crime? An important consideration in using this data is defining what a “violent crime” is. One definition, and the one that I think makes the most sense, is that a violent crime is one that uses force or the threat of force. For example, if I punch you in the face, that is a violent crime. If I stab you, that is a violent crime. While clearly different in terms of severity, both incidents used force so I believe would be classified as a violent crime. The FBI, and most researchers, reporters, and advocates would disagree. Organizations ranging from the FBI itself to Pew Research Center and advocacy groups like the Vera Institute of Justice and the ACLU all define the first example as a non-violent crime and the second as a violent crime. They do this for three main reasons. The first reason is that simple assault is not an index crime, so they don’t include it when measuring violent crime. It is almost a tautology in criminology that you use index crimes as the measure of crime since that’s just what people do. As far as I’m aware, this is really the main reason why researchers justify using index crimes: because people in the past used it so that’s just what is done now.9 This strikes me as a particularly awful way of doing anything, more so since simple assault data has been available almost as long as index crime data.10 The second reason - and one that I think makes sense for reporters and advocates who are less familiar with the data, but should be unacceptable to researchers - is that people don’t know that simple assault is included, or at least don’t have easy access to it. Neither the FBI’s annual report page not their official crime data tool website include simple assault since they only include index crimes. For people who rely only on these sources - and given that using the data itself requires at least some programming skills, I think this accounts for most users and certainly nearly all non-researchers - it is not possible to access simple assault crime data (arrest data does include simple assault on these sites) from these official sources. The final reason is that it benefits some people’s goals to classify violent crime as only including index crimes. This is because simple assault is extremely common compared to violent index crimes - in many cities simple assault is more common than all violent index crimes put together - so excluding simple assault makes it seem like fewer arrests are violent than they are when including simple assault. For example, a number of articles have noted that marijuana arrests are more common than violent crime arrests (Ingraham 2016; Kertscher 2019; Devito 2020; Earlenbaugh 2020; Edwards et al. 2020) or that violent crime arrests are only 5% of all arrests (Neusteter and O’Toole 2019; Speri 2019).11 While true when considering only violent index crimes, including simple assault as a violent crime makes these statements false. Some organizations call the violent index crimes “serious violent crimes” which is an improvement but even this is a misnomer since simple assault can lead to more serious harm than aggravated assault. An assault becomes aggravated if using a weapon or there is the potential for serious harm, even if no harm actually occurs.12 As an example of this last point, Figure 2.3 shows the number of violent index crimes and simple assaults each year from 1960 to 2018 in Houston, Texas (simple assault is not reported in UCR until 1964, which is why 1960-1963 show zero simple assaults). In every year where simple assault is reported, there are more simple assaults than aggravated assaults. Beginning in the late 1980s, there are also more simple assaults than total violent index crimes. Excluding simple assault from being a violent crime greatly underestimates violence in the country. Figure 2.3: Reported crimes in Houston, Texas, from 1960 to 2018. Violent index crimes are aggravated assault, rape, robbery, and murder. 2.2 Issues common across UCR datasets In this section we’ll discuss issues common to most or all of the UCR datasets. For some of these, we’ll come back to the issues in more detail in the chapter for the datasets most affected by the problem. 2.2.1 Negative numbers One of the most common questions people have about this data is why there are negative numbers, and if they are a mistake. Negative numbers are not a mistake. The UCR data is monthly so police agencies report the number of monthly crimes that are known to them - either reported to them or discovered by the police. In some cases the police will determine that a crime reported to them didn’t actually occur - which they called an “unfounded crime.” An example that the FBI gives for this is a person reports their wallet stolen (a theft) and then later finds it, so a crime was initially reported but no crime actually occurred. How this works when the police input the data is that an unfounded crime is reported both as an unfounded crime and as a negative actual crime - the negative is used to zero out the erroneous report of the actual crime. So the report would look like 1 actual theft (the crime being reported), -1 theft (the crime being discovered as not have happened), and 1 unfounded theft. If both incidents occurred in the same month then this would simply be a single unfounded theft occurring, with no actual theft - literally a value of 1 + -1 = 0 thefts. Negative values occur when the unfounding happens in a later month than the crime report. In the theft case, let’s say the theft occurred in January and the discovery of the wallet happens in August. Assuming no other crimes occurred, January would have 1 theft, and August would have -1 thefts and 1 unfounded theft. There is no way of determining in which month (or even which year) an unfounded crime was initially reported in. When averaging over the long term, there shouldn’t be any negative numbers as the actual and unfounded reports will cancel themselves out. However, when looking at monthly crimes - particularly for rare crimes - you’ll still see negative numbers for this reason. Since crimes can be unfounded for reports in previous years, you can actually see entire year’s crime counts be negative, though this is much rarer than monthly values.13 2.2.2 Agency population value Each of the UCR datasets include a population variable that has the estimated population under the jurisdiction of that agency.14 This variable is often used to create crime rates that control for population. In cases where jurisdiction overlaps, such as when a city has university police agencies or county sheriffs in counties where the cities in that county have their own police, UCR data assigns the population covered to the most local agency and zero population to the overlapping agency. So an agency’s population is the number of people in that jurisdiction that isn’t already covered by a different agency. For example, the city of Los Angeles in California has nearly four million residents according to the US Census. There are multiple police agencies in the city, including the Los Angeles Police Department, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Office, the California Highway Patrol that operates in the area, airport and port police, and university police departments. If each agency reported the number of people in their jurisdiction - which all overlap with each other - we would end up with a population far higher than LA’s four million people. To prevent double-counting population when agency’s jurisdictions overlap, the non-primary agency will report a population of 0, even though they still report crime data like normal. As an example, in 2018 the police department for California State University - Los Angeles reported 92 thefts and a population of 0. Those 92 thefts are not counted in the Los Angeles Police Department data, even though the department counts the population. To get complete crime counts in Los Angeles, you’d need to add up all police agencies within in the city; since the population value is 0 for non-LAPD agencies, both the population and the crime sum will be correct. The UCR uses this method even when only parts of a jurisdiction overlaps. Los Angeles County Sheriff has a population of about one million people, far less than the actual county population (the number of residents, according to the Census) of about 10 million people. This is because the other nine million people are accounted for by other agencies, mainly the local police agencies in the cities that make up Los Angeles County. The population value is the population who reside in that jurisdiction and does not count people who are in the area but don’t live there, such as tourists or people who commute there for work. This means that using the population value to determine a rate can be misleading as some places have much higher numbers of non-residents in the area (e.g. Las Vegas, Washington D.C.) than others. 2.2.3 Reporting is voluntary … so some agencies don’t (or report partially) When an agency reports their data to the FBI, they do so voluntarily - there is no national requirement to report.15 This means that there is inconsistency in which agencies report, how many months of the year they report for, and which variables they include in their data submissions. In general, more agencies report their data every year and once an agency begins reporting data they tend to keep reporting. The UCR datasets are a collection of separate, though related, datasets and an agency can report to as many of these datasets as they want - an agency that reports to one dataset does not mean that they report to other datasets. Figure 2.4 shows the number of agencies that submitted at least one month of data to the Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest data in the given year. For the first decade of available data under 8,000 agencies reported data and this grew to over 13,500 by the late 1970s before plateauing for about a decade. The number of agencies that reported their data actually declined in the 1990s, driven primarily by many Florida agencies temporarily dropping out, before growing steadily to nearly 17,000 agencies in 2010; from here it kept increasing but slower than before. Figure 2.4: The annual number of agencies reporting to the Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest dataset. Reporting is based on the agency reporting at least one month of data in that year. There are approximately 18,000 police agencies in the United States so recent data has reports from nearly all agencies, while older data has far fewer agencies reporting. When trying to estimate to larger geographies, such as state or national-level, later years will be more accurate as you’re missing less data. For earlier data, however, you’re dealing with a smaller share of agencies meaning that you have a large amount of missing data and a less representative sample. Figure 2.5 repeats the above figure but now including only agencies with 100,000 people or more in their jurisdiction. While these agencies have a far more linear trend than all agencies, the basic lesson is the same: recent data has most agencies reporting; old data excludes many agencies. Figure 2.5: The annual number of agencies with a population of 100,000 or higher reporting to the Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest dataset. Reporting is based on the agency reporting at least one month of data in that year. This voluntariness extends beyond whether they report or not, but into which variables they report. While in practice most agencies report every crime when they report any, they do have the choice to report only a subset of offenses. This is especially true for subsets of larger categories - such as gun assaults, a subset of aggravated assaults, or marijuana possession arrests which is a subset of drug possession arrests. As an example, Figure 2.6 shows the annual number of aggravated assaults with a gun in New York City. In 2003 the New York Police Department stopped reporting this category of offense, resuming only in 2013. They continued to report the broader aggravated assault category, but not any of the subsections of aggravated assaults which say which weapon was used during the assault. Figure 2.6: Monthly reports of gun assaults in New York City, 1960-2022. Given that agencies can join or drop out of the UCR program at will, and report only partial data, it is highly important to carefully examine your data to make sure that there are no issues caused by this. Even when an agency reports UCR data, and even when they report every crime category, they can report fewer than 12 months of data. In some cases they simply report all of their data in December, or report quarterly or semi-annually so some months have zero crimes reported while others count multiple months in that month’s data. One example of this is New York City, shown in Figure 2.7, in the early-2000s to the mid-2010s where they began reporting data quarterly instead of monthly. Figure 2.7: Monthly murders in New York City, 1990-2022. During the 2000s, the police department began reporting quarterly instead of monthly and then resumed monthly reporting. When you sum up each month into an annual count, as shown in Figure 2.8, the problem disappears since the zero months are accounted for in the months that have the quarterly data. If you’re using monthly data and only examine the data at the annual level, you’ll fall into the trap of having incorrect data that is hidden due to the level of aggregation examined. While cases like NYC are obvious when viewed monthly, for people that are including thousands of agencies in their data, it is unfeasible to look at each agency for each crime included. This can introduce errors as the best way to examine the data is manually viewing graphs and the automated method, looking for outliers through some kind of comparison to expected values, can be incorrect. Figure 2.8: Annual murders in New York City, 1990-2022. In other cases when agencies report fewer than 12 months of the year, they simply report partial data and as a result undercount crimes. Figure 2.9 shows annual murders in Miami-Dade, Florida and has three years of this issue occurring. The first two years with this issue are the two where zero murders are reported - this is because the agency didn’t report any months of data. The final year is in 2018, the last year of data in this graph, where it looks like murder suddenly dropped significantly. That’s just because Miami-Dade only reported through June, so they’re missing half of 2018. Figure 2.9: Annual murders in Miami-Dade, Florida, 1960-2022. 2.2.4 Zero crimes vs no reports When an agency does not report, we see it in the data as reporting zero crimes, not reporting NA or any indicator that they did not report. In cases where the agency says they didn’t report that month we can be fairly sure (not entirely since that variable isn’t always accurate) that the zero crimes reported are simply that the agency didn’t report. In cases where the agency says they report that month but report zero crimes, we can’t be sure if that’s a true no crimes reported to the agency or the agency not reporting to the UCR. As agencies can report some crimes but not others in a given month and still be considered reporting that month, just saying they reported doesn’t mean that the zero is a true zero. In some cases it is easy to see when a zero crimes reported is actually the agency not reporting. As Figure 2.6 shows with New York City gun assaults, there is a massive and sustained dropoff to zero crimes and then a sudden return years later. Obviously, going from hundreds of crimes to zero crimes is not a matter of crimes not occurring anymore, it is a matter of the agency not reporting - and New York City did report other crimes these years so in the data it says that they reported every month. So in agencies which tend to report many crimes - and many here can be a few as 10 a year since going from 10 to 0 is a big drop - a sudden report of zero crimes is probably just non-reporting. Differentiating zero crimes and no reports becomes tricky in agencies that tend to report few crimes, which most small towns do. As an example, Figure 2.10 shows the annual reports of rape in Danville, California, a city of approximately 45,000 people. The city reports on average 2.8 rapes per year and in five years reported zero rapes. In cases like this it’s not clear whether we should consider those zero years as true zeros (that no one was raped or reported their rape to the police) or whether the agency simply didn’t report rape data that year. Figure 2.10: Annual rapes reported in Danville, CA, 1960-2022. 2.3 A summary of each UCR dataset The UCR collection of data can be roughly summarized into two groups: crime data and arrest data. While there are several datasets included in the UCR data collection, they are all extensions of one of the above groups. For arrest data, you have information about who (by race and by age-gender, but not by race-gender or race-age other than within race you know if the arrestee is an adult or a juvenile) was arrested for each crime. For crime data, you have monthly counts of a small number of crimes (many fewer than crimes covered in the arrest data) and then more specialized data on a subset of these crimes - information on homicides, hate crimes, assaults or killings of police officers, and stolen property. Each of these datasets will have its own chapter in this book where we discuss the data thoroughly. Here is a very brief summary of each dataset which will help you know which one to use for your research. I still recommend reading that data’s chapter since it covers important caveats and uses (or misuses) of the data that won’t be covered below. 2.3.1 Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest The Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest dataset - often called Return A, “Offenses Known” or, less commonly, OKCA - is the oldest and most commonly used dataset and measures crimes reported to the police. For this reason it is used as the main measure of crime in the United States, and I tend to call it the “crimes dataset.” This data includes the monthly number of crimes reported to the police or otherwise known to the police (e.g. discovered while on patrol) for a small selection of crimes, as well as the number of crimes cleared by arrest or by “exceptional means” (a relatively flawed and manipulable measure of whether the case is “solved”). It also covers the number reported but found by police to have not occurred. Since this data has monthly agency-level crime information it is often used to measure crime trends between police agencies and over time. The data uses something called a Hierarchy Rule which means that in incidents with multiple crimes, only the most serious is recorded - though in practice this affects only a small percent of cases, and primarily affects property crimes. 2.3.2 Arrests by Age, Sex, and Race The Arrests by Age, Sex, and Race dataset - often called ASR or the “arrests data” - includes the monthly number of arrests for a variety of crimes and, unlike the crime data, breaks down this data by age and gender. This data includes a broader number of crime categories than the crime dataset (the Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest data) though is less detailed on violent crimes since it does not breakdown aggravated assault or robberies by weapon type as the Offenses Known data does. For each crime it says the number of arrests for each gender-age group with younger ages (15-24) showing the arrestee’s age to the year (e.g. age 16) and other ages grouping years together (e.g. age 25-29, 30-34, “under 10”). It also breaks down arrests by race-age by including the number of arrestees of each race (American Indian, Asian, Black, and White are the only included races) and if the arrestee is a juvenile (&lt;18 years old) or an adult. The data does technically include a breakdown by ethnicity-age (e.g. juvenile-Hispanic, juvenile-non-Hispanic) but almost no agencies report this data (for many years zero agencies report ethnicity) so in practice the data does not include ethnicity. As the data includes counts of arrestees, people who are arrested multiple times are included in the data multiple times - it is not a measure of unique arrestees. 2.3.3 Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted (LEOKA) The Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted data, often called just by its acronym LEOKA, has two main purposes.16 First, it provides counts of employees employed by each agency - broken down by if they are civilian employees or sworn officers, and also broken down by gender. And second, it measures how many officers were assaulted or killed (including officers who die accidentally such as in a car crash) in a given month. The assault data is also broken down into shift type (e.g. alone, with a partner, on foot, in a car, etc.), the offender’s weapon, and type of call they are responding to (e.g. robbery, disturbance, traffic stop). The killed data simply says how many officers are killed feloniously (i.e. murdered) or died accidentally (e.g. car crash) in a given month. The employee information is at the year-level so you know, for example, how many male police officers were employed in a given year at an agency, but don’t know any more than that such as if the number employed changed over the year. This dataset is commonly used as a measure of police employees and is a generally reliable measure of how many police are employed by a police agency. The second part of this data, measuring assaults and deaths, is more flawed with missing data issues and data error issues (e.g. more officers killed than employed in an agency). 2.3.4 Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR) The Supplementary Homicide Reports dataset - often abbreviated to SHR - is the most detailed of the UCR datasets and provides information about the circumstances and participants (victim and offender demographics and relationship status) for homicides.17 For each homicide incident it tells you the age, gender, race, and ethnicity of each victim and offender as well as the relationship between the first victim and each of the offenders (but not the other victims in cases where there are multiple victims). It also tells you the weapon used by each offender and the circumstance of the killing, such as a “lovers triangle” or a gang-related murder. As with other UCR data, it also tells you the agency it occurred in and the month and year when the crime happened. 2.3.5 Hate Crime Data This dataset covers crimes that are reported to the police and judged by the police `to be motivated by hate. More specifically, they are, first, crimes which were, second, motivated - at least in part - by bias towards a certain person or group of people because of characteristics about them such as race, sexual orientation, or religion. The first part is key, they must be crimes - and really must be the selection of crimes that the FBI collects for this dataset. Biased actions that don’t meet the standard of a crime, or are of a crime not included in this data, are not considered hate crimes. For example, if someone yells at a Black person and uses racial slurs against them, it is clearly a racist action. For it to be included in this data, however, it would have to extend to a threat since “intimidation” is a crime included in this data but lesser actions such as simply insulting someone is not included. For the second part, the bias motivation, it must be against a group that the FBI includes in this data. For example, when this data collection began crimes against transgender people were not counted so if a transgender person was assaulted or killed because they were transgender, this is not a hate crime recorded in the data (though it would have counted in the “Anti-Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Or Transgender, Mixed Group (LGBT)” bias motivation which was always reported).18 So this data is really a narrower measure of hate crimes than it might seem. In practice it is (some) crimes motivated by (some) kinds of hate that are reported to the police. It is also the most under-reported UCR dataset with most agencies not reporting any hate crimes to the FBI. This leads to huge gaps in the data with some states having extremely few agencies reporting crime - see, for example Figure 2.11 for state-level hate crimes in 2018 - agencies reporting some bias motivations but not others, agencies reporting some years but not others. While these problems exist for all of the UCR datasets, it is most severe in this data. This problem is exacerbated by hate crimes being rare even in agencies that report them - with such rare events, even minor changes in which agencies report or which types of offenses they include can have large effects. Figure 2.11: Total reported hate crimes by state, 2022. 2.3.6 Property Stolen and Recovered (Supplement to Return A) The Property Stolen and Recovered data - sometimes called the Supplement to Return A (Return A being another name for the Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest dataset, the “crime” dataset) - provides monthly information about property-related offenses (theft, motor vehicle theft, robbery, and burglary), including the location of the offense (in broad categories like “gas station” or “residence”), what was stolen (e.g. clothing, livestock, firearms), and how much the stolen items were worth.19 The “recovered” part of this dataset covers the type and value of property recovered so you can use this, along with the type and value of property stolen, to determine what percent and type of items the police managed to recover. Like other UCR datasets this is at the agency-month level so you can, for example, learn how often burglaries occur at the victim’s home during the day, and if that rate changes over the year or differs across agencies. The data, however, provides no information about the offender or the victim (other than if the victim was an individual or a commercial business [based on the location of the incident - “bank”, “gas station”, etc.]). The value of the property stolen is primarily based on the victim’s estimate of how much the item is worth (items that are decreased in value once used - such as cars - are supposed to be valued at the current market rate, but the data provides no indication of when it uses the current market rate or the victim’s estimate) so it should be used as a very rough estimate of value. 2.3.7 Arson The arson dataset provides monthly counts at the police agency-level for arsons that occur, and includes a breakdown of arsons by the type of arson (e.g. arson of a person’s home, arson of a vehicle, arson of a community/public building) and the estimated value of the damage caused by the arson. This data includes all arsons reported to the police or otherwise known to the police (e.g. discovered while on patrol) and also has a count of arsons that lead to an arrest (of at least one person who committed the arson) and reports that turned out to not be arsons (such as if an investigation found that the fire was started accidentally). For each type of arson it includes the number of arsons where the structure was uninhabited or otherwise not in use, so you can estimate the percent of arsons of buildings which had the potential to harm people. This measure is for structures where people normally did not inhabit the structure - such as a vacant building where no one lives. A home where no one is home at the time of the arson does not count as an uninhabited building. In cases where the arson led to a death, that death would be recorded as a murder on the Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest dataset - but not indicated anywhere on this dataset. If an individual who responds to the arson dies because of it, such as a police officer or a firefighter, this is not considered a homicide (though the officer death is still included in the Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted data) unless the arsonist intended to cause their deaths. Even though the UCR uses the Hierarchy Rule, where only the most serious offense that occurs is recorded, all arsons are reported - arson is exempt from the Hierarchy Rule. 2.4 How to identify a particular agency (ORI codes) In the UCR and other FBI data sets, agencies are identified using ORiginating Agency Identifiers or an ORI. An ORI is a unique ID code used to identify an agency.20 If we used the agency’s name we’d end up with some duplicates since there can be multiple agencies in the country (and in a state, those this is very rare) with the same name. For example, if you looked for the Philadelphia Police Department using the agency name, you’d find both the “Philadelphia Police Department” in Pennsylvania and the one in Mississippi. Each ORI is a 7-digit value starting with the state abbreviation (for some reason the FBI incorrectly puts the abbreviation for Nebraska as NB instead of NE) followed by 5 numbers.21 When dealing with specific agencies, make sure to use the ORI rather than the agency name to avoid any mistakes. For an easy way to find the ORI number of an agency, use this page on my site. Type an agency name or an ORI code into the search section and it will return everything that is a match. 2.5 The data as you get it from the FBI We’ll finish this overview of the UCR data by briefly talking about format of the data that is released by the FBI, before the processing done by myself or NACJD that converts the data to a type that software like R or Stata or Excel can understand. The FBI releases their data as fixed-width ASCII files which are basically just an Excel file but with all of the columns squished together. As an example, Figure 11.5 shows what the data looks like as you receive it from the FBI for the Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest dataset for 1960, the first year with data available. In the figure, it seems like there are multiple rows but that’s just because the software that I opened the file in isn’t wide enough - in reality what is shown is a single row that is extremely wide because there are over 1,500 columns in this data. If you scroll down enough you’ll see the next row, but that isn’t shown in the current image. What is shown is a single row with a ton of columns all pushed up next to each other. Since all of the columns are squished together (the gaps are just blank spaces because the value there is a space, but that doesn’t mean there is a in the data. Spaces are possible values in the data and are meaningful), you need some way to figure out which parts of the data belong in which column. Figure 2.12: Fixed-width ASCII file for the 1960 Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest dataset. The “fixed-width” part of the file type is how this works (the ASCII part basically means it’s a text file). Each row is the same width - literally the same number of characters, including blank spaces. So you must tell the software you are using to process this file - by literally writing code in something called a “setup file” but is basically just instructions for whatever software you use (R, SPSS, Stata, SAS can all do this) - which characters are certain columns. For example, in this data the first character says which type of UCR data it is (1 means the Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest data) and the next two characters (in the setup file written as 2-3 since it is characters 2 through 3 [inclusive]) are the state number (01 is the state code for Alabama). So we can read this row as the first column indicating it is an Offenses Known data, the second column indicating that it is for the state of Alabama, and so on for each of the remaining columns. To read in this data you’ll need a setup file that covers every column in the data (some software, like R, can handle just reading in the specific columns you want and don’t need to include every column in the setup file). The second important thing to know about reading in a fixed-width ASCII file is something called a “value label.”22 For example, in the above image we saw the characters 2-3 is the state and in the row we have the value “01” which means that the state is “Alabama.” Since this type of data is trying to be as small as efficient as possible, it often replaces longer values with shorter one and provides a translation for the software to use to convert it to the proper value when reading it. “Alabama” is more characters than “01” so it saves space to say “01” and just replace that with “Alabama” later on. So “01” would be the “value” and “Alabama” would be the “label” that it changes to once read. Fixed-width ASCII files may seem awful to you reading it today, and it is awful to use. But it appears to be an efficient way to store data back many decades ago when data releases began but now is extremely inefficient - in terms of speed, file size, ease of use - compared to modern software so I’m not sure why they still release data in this format. But they do, and even the more modern (if starting in 1991, before I was born, is modern!) NIBRS data comes in this format. For you, however, the important part to understand is not how exactly to read this type of data, but to understand that people who made this data publicly available (such as myself and the team at NACJD) must make this conversion process.23 This conversion process, from fixed-width ASCII to a useful format is the most dangerous step taken in using this data - and one that is nearly entirely unseen by researchers. Every line of code you write (or, for SPSS users, click you make) invites the possibility of making a mistake.24 The FBI does not provide a setup file with the fixed-width ASCII data so to read in this data you need to make it yourself. Since some UCR data are massive, this involves assigning the column width for thousands of columns and the value labels for hundreds of different value labels.25 A typo anywhere could have potentially far-reaching consequences, so this is a crucial weak point in the data cleaning process - and one in which I have not seen anything written about before. While I have been diligent in checking the setup files and my code to seek out any issues - and I know that NACJD has a robust checking process for their own work - that doesn’t mean our work is perfect.26 Even with perfection in processing the raw data to useful files, decisions we make (e.g. what level to aggregate to, what is an outlier) can affect both what type of questions you can ask when using this data, and how well you can answer them.

For this reason it is used as the main measure of crime in the United States, and I tend to call it the “crimes dataset.” This data includes the monthly number of crimes reported to the police or otherwise known to the police (e.g. discovered while on patrol) for a small selection of crimes, as well as the number of crimes cleared by arrest or by “exceptional means” (a relatively flawed and manipulable measure of whether the case is “solved”). It also covers the number reported but found by police to have not occurred. Since this data has monthly agency-level crime information it is often used to measure crime trends between police agencies and over time. The data uses something called a Hierarchy Rule which means that in incidents with multiple crimes, only the most serious is recorded - though in practice this affects only a small percent of cases, and primarily affects property crimes. 3.1 Which crimes are included? This data set contains information on the number of “Index Crimes” (sometimes called Part I crimes) reported to each agency. These index crimes are a collection of eight crimes that, for historical reasons based largely by perceived importance and reliable of their reporting in the 1920’s when the UCR program was first developed, are used as the primary measure of crime today. Other data sets in the UCR, such as the Arrests by Age, Sex, and Race data and the Hate Crime data have more crimes reported. The crimes are, in order by the Hierarchy Rule (which we’ll discuss next): Homicide Murder and non-negligent manslaughter Manslaughter by negligence Rape Rape Attempted rape Robbery With a firearm With a knife of cutting instrument With a dangerous weapon not otherwise specified Unarmed - using hands, fists, feet, etc. Aggravated Assault (assault with a weapon or with the intent to cause serious bodily injury) With a firearm With a knife of cutting instrument With a dangerous weapon not otherwise specified Unarmed - using hands, fists, feet, etc. Burglary With forcible entry Without forcible entry Attempted burglary with forcible entry Theft (other than of a motor vehicle) Motor Vehicle Theft Cars Trucks and buses Other vehicles Arson Simple Assault Arson is considered an index crime but is not reported in this data - you need to use the separate Arson data set of the UCR to get access to arson counts. See Chapter 8 for an overview of the Arson data. The ninth crime on that list, simple assault, is not considered an index crime but is nevertheless included in this data. Each of the crimes in the list above, and their subcategories, are included in the UCR data. In most news and academic articles, however, you’ll see them reported as the total number of index crimes, summing up categories 1-7 and reporting that as “crime.” These index crimes are often divided into violent index crimes - murder, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault - and property index crimes - burglary, theft, motor vehicle theft. For more on index crimes, and the drawbacks of using them, please see Section 2.1.3. 3.1.1 Hierarchy Rule This dataset uses what is called the Hierarchy Rule where only the most serious crime in an incident is reported (except for motor vehicle theft and arson, which are always included). For example if there is an incident where the victim is robbed and then murdered, only the murder is counted as it is considered more serious than the robbery. That the data uses the Hierarchy Rule is an oft-cited (by academics, reporters, random people on Twitter) criticism of the data that is, in my opinion, overblown. In practice, the Hierarchy Rule has only modest effects on the data, undercounting few crimes. Though the Hierarchy Rule does mean this data is an undercount, data from other sources indicate that it isn’t much of an under count. The FBI’s other data set, the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) contains every crime that occurs in an incident (i.e. it doesn’t use the Hierarchy Rule). Using this we can measure how many crimes the Hierarchy Rule excludes (Most major cities do not report to NIBRS so what we find in NIBRS may not apply to them). In over 90% of incidents, only one crime is committed. Additionally, when people talk about “crime” they usually mean murder which, while incomplete to discuss crime, means the UCR data here is accurate on that measure. The FBI also released a report available here in 2015 that directly examined this issue by taking NIBRS data from 2014 and examined how NIBRS data (which includes all crimes) compares to using the Hierarchy Rule and keeping only the most serious crime. Figure 3.1 is a screenshot from their report showing the percent increases in crimes when including all crimes in an incident relative to following the Hierarchy Rule. They find that 10.6% of incidents have multiple crimes occurring, which is similar to other years of data that I have examined myself. For violent crime, murder and rape have no change; for the remaining violent crimes - robbery and aggravated assault - crimes increased by 0.6%.27 Burglary increased by 1% and the largest increases came from theft and motor vehicle theft, increasing by 2.6% and 2.7%, respectively. Curiously motor vehicle theft increased even though the FBI’s documentation for this data says that it is exempt from the Hierarchy Rule and should always be reported. This suggests either non-compliance or that the manual is incorrect. Figure 3.1: The FBI’s findings of how crime reporting changes when using the Hierarchy Rule using NIBRS 2014 data. So using the Hierarchy Rule does undercount crime, but this is a small undercounting and is primarily led by property crime. Violent crime is only slightly undercounted. Please keep in mind that this is for crimes that the police record and is unaffected by outside decisions like what the district attorney charges or what the defendant is ultimately convicted of. 3.2 Agencies reporting Figure 3.2 shows the annual number of police agencies that reported at least one month that year. With data starting in 1960, there were a little under 7,500 agencies reporting a year until 1970 when the number of agencies began increasing. This continued until the late 1970s when about 14,000 agencies reported, and this remained steady for over a decade before declining in the 1990s until about 12,500 in the latter half of the decade. Then the number of agencies reporting increased steadily until about 16,500 agencies reported in 2010. The number of agencies has slowly increased since then, adding a few hundred agencies from 2010 to 2018. While this data is available through 2019, this graph only shows data through 2018. As this graph shows agencies that report at least one month, it overcounts reporting agencies as some report fewer than every month in the year. Agencies that do report, however, tend to report all 12 months of the year so this problem is not necessarily serious, though it depends on the agencies you’re looking at. Figure 3.2: The annual number of agencies reporting to the Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest dataset. Reporting is based on the agency reporting at least one month of data in that year. Figure 3.3 repeats the above figure but now including only agencies with 100,000 people or more in their jurisdiction. While these agencies have a far more linear trend than all agencies, the basic lesson is the same: recent data has most agencies reporting; old data excludes many agencies. Figure 3.3: The annual number of agencies with a population of 100,000 or higher reporting to the Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest dataset. Reporting is based on the agency reporting at least one month of data in that year. 3.3 Important variables For each crime we have four different categories indicating the number of crimes actually committed, the number cleared, and the number determined to not have occurred. Like other UCR data, there are also variables that provide information about the agency - ORI codes, population under jurisdiction - the month and year that the data covers, and how many months reported data. 3.3.1 Actual crimes This is the number of offenses that actually occurred - where actually means that a police investigation found that the crime report was accurate. Crimes that are reported that the police find did not occur (e.g. report of an arson but turns that the fire began accidentally) are called “unfounded” crimes. So this variable is the one people use to measure crime. For example if 10 people are murdered in a city the number of “actual murders” would be 10. A crime is a crime incident, regardless of how many offenders there were. If there are multiple victims in a case, such as a double murder, then it would count as multiple crimes. 3.3.2 Total cleared crimes A crime is cleared when an offender is arrested or when the case is considered cleared by exceptional means. To be more specific, this data counts crime as a crime incident, regardless of the number of offenders. For example, if 3 people robbed a person, that is one crime of robbery, not 3 separate crimes. This crime is cleared when one of the three robbers is arrested - no matter the outcome for the other two robbers. Arresting all 3 still counts as a single robbery cleared. Even though this dataset is formally named “Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest” it does include clearances where no one is arrested, which are called “exceptional clearances” or “clearances by exceptional means.” For exceptional clearances, police must have identified the offender, have sufficient evidence to arrest that offender, know where they are (so they can actually be apprehended) and only then be unable to make the arrest. Exceptional clearances include cases where the offender dies before an arrest (by any means, including suicide, accidental, illness, killed by someone including a police officer) or when the police are unable to arrest the person since they are already in custody by another jurisdiction (including out of the country or in custody of another agency) and extradition is denied. Two other potential causes of exceptional clearance are when prosecution of the case cannot go forward because the district attorney refuses to prosecute the case, for reasons other than lack of evidence, or when a victim refuses to assist the prosecution in the case. Unfortunately, this data does not differentiate between clearances by arrest or by exceptional means so there’s no way to determine how many clearances mean the offender is actually arrested - and even more problematic, how many clearances have all of the offenders arrested.28 There is also evidence that police agencies report classify large numbers of clearances as clearances through exception means (again, we have no way to tell which is which using this data) even though exceptional clearances should be rare given that times where the offender is known but cannot be arrested are likely far less common than when they are arrested. This is particularly a problem in the case of rapes where in some cases there are far more exceptional clearances than clearances by arrest (Yeung et al. 2018). For an excellent investigation into this issue, please read the Yeung et al. (2018) article available on ProPublica’s website here Clearances are reported in the month that they occur, regardless of when the crime they are clearing occurred. In practice, however, most crimes are cleared in the month that they occur. According to the 2019 NIBRS, it takes on average 7 days between the incident and the arrest (median = 0 days) date when averaging across all crimes - for individual crimes these values will be different. This means that most of the clearances will be for the same month as the initial crime - though less so as the month comes to a close. Of course, police agencies can solve older cases - and even target cold cases to be solved - so this is still a degree of uncertainty for which month these clearances are for. Still, there are occasionally months - and even years - where there are more reported crimes cleared than crimes that occur. Figure 3.4 shows the number of actual and cleared murders from the Montgomery County Police Department in Maryland. Several years have more murders cleared than were committed - a sign that the month of clearance does not correspond to the month of occurrence, rather than the police solving crime before it happened.29 Figure 3.4: The annual number of actual and cleared murders from the Montgomery County Police Department, MD, 1960-2022. 3.3.3 Crimes cleared where all offenders are under 18 years old This variable is a subset of the Total Cleared variable and only includes clearances for offenses in which every offender is younger than age 18. Since this requires that the police know, or at least believe, the age of every offender, it is probably highly inaccurate. This category includes cases where the juvenile is given a citation to show up in court for their trial and is not formally arrested and taken into custody. 3.3.4 Unfounded crimes An unfounded crime is one in which a police investigation has determined that the reported crime did not actually happen. For example I observed during a ride-along a report of a burglary where the homeowners said that they came home, and the front door was open and they thought it might have been their son who forgot to close it but were worried that it could be a burglar, so they called the police just in case. This would be recorded as a burglary and if it turned out to be the son, the police would then record this as an unfounded burglary. Other unfounded crimes would include when someone reports a crime but later says that the report wasn’t true. For example, a person could report a burglary to the police to collect insurance money on the items they claim was stolen. If the police discover this they would unfound the case - and the lying to the police and fraud would not be counted as neither of those are crimes included in this dataset. Unfounding crimes are especially common for rapes. If a person reports that they were raped and then later say that this report isn’t true - and doing so is relatively common, especially for child sexual abuse victims, even when the rape did actually happen - then the police will unfound the case. Figure 3.5 provides one example of this by showing the number of actual - that is, rapes that the police say actually occurred - and unfounded rapes annually from 1960-2022 in Philadelphia, PA. Interestingly, the spike in actual rapes in 2013 due to the new rape definition that year (discussed below) does not correspond to a spike in unfounded rapes - which suggests that this variable is not being reported properly. It is unlikely that the number of rapes would spike so much without any corresponding increase - and an actual decrease - in unfounded rapes. Since unfounded rapes are so common, especially compared to other crimes - and evidence that police also misreport clearances for rape - this variable is likely to be manipulated by the police to make it appear that there are fewer rapes than there actually is. As such, this variable - and relatedly the actual crimes variable” is not reliable, especially for rapes. How unreliable, of course depends on the specific offense and the agency reporting. Figure 3.5: The annual number of actual and unfounded rapes in Philadelphia, PA, 1960-2022. Another way to look at this data is the percent of rapes that were unfounded. Since unfounded and actual rapes are distinct categories, we’ll need to divide unfounded rapes by the sum of actual and unfounded rapes and then multiple the result by 100. Please note that unfounding occurs in the month the police discover the case to be unfounded, it is not tied to the month of the original report. So this graph isn’t really showing the percent that year that were unfounded - but for our purposes of getting a general sense it is acceptable. Usually about 10% of reported rapes are unfounded in Philadelphia. The 44% in 1983, the first year with data, is probably high due to it accounting for unfounded cases in previous years that weren’t reported in the data until 1983. Figure 3.6: The percent of reported rapes that the police recorded as unfounded in Philadelphia, PA, 1960-2022. As a comparison, Figure 3.7 shows the percent of robberies that are recorded as unfounded in Philadelphia over the same time period. While the percent has been increasing, for most of the data it is under 1% and never exceeds 3%. To me this suggests that the Philly Police, and they aren’t unique, are overcounting rapes as unfounded to improve their rape statistic data. Figure 3.7: The percent of reported robberies that the police recorded as unfounded in Philadelphia, PA, 1960-2022. 3.4 Important issues 3.4.1 Rape definition change The FBI changed the definition of rape for UCR data starting in 2013 to a broader definition than the older definition, which is commonly called the “legacy definition” or “legacy” or “historical” rape. The legacy definition is “the carnal knowledge of a female forcibly and against her will” (emphasis added). This means that only rape is only included in UCR data when it is a female (or any age, there is no differentiation for child victims) forcibly vaginally penetrated by a penis. This is a narrow definition and excludes a number of sexual acts that people may consider rape such as forced oral or anal sex, and cases with a male victim. The new (and current) definition “penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim.” Starting in 2013, rape has a new, broader definition in the UCR to include oral and anal penetration (by a body part or object) and to allow men to be victims. The new definition is: “Penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim.” The previous definition included only forcible intercourse against a woman. This definition is far broader and is effectively any non-consensual sexual act. It also includes male victims though the data does not differentiate between male or female (or any other gender) victims. Both the current and legacy definitions exclude statutory rape and incest other than forcible incest. They both also include lack of consent as cases where the victim cannot give consent, such as if they are too young or are mentally or physically incapacitated - the FBI specifically give the example of being temporarily incapacitated through drugs or alcohol. As this revised definition is broader than the original one post-2013, rape data is not comparable to pre-2013 data. 2013, however, is simply the year that the FBI changed the definition which means that agencies should have changed their reporting to the new definition. As might not be too surprising, not all agencies followed this requirement. We’ll look at four examples to show when there is clear evidence that the agency did change their definition in 2013, when it’s clear they did so a year later, when it’s unclear exactly when they made the change, and when the agency seems to not follow the change at all. We’ll start with the Philadelphia Police Department in Philadelphia, PA, shown in Figure 3.8 which shows the annual number of rapes from 2000-2018. It’s declining slowly but steadily over the 2000-2012 time period until spiking sharply in 2013. Since the rape definition change in 2013 is far broader than previous year’s definition, this makes sense. A broader definition should lead to a sudden increase in reported rapes if the agency is reporting correctly. Figure 3.8: The annual number of rapes reported in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 2000-2018. In comparison, New York City has the sudden spike a year later, which indicates that they didn’t start using the new definition until 2014. Figure 3.9 shows that rape is fairly steady, though increasing, in the years leading up to 2013 and has almost no change from 2012 to 2013, but a huge increase in 2014 and then steadily increases from there, spiking again in 2018. This seems like a fairly clear indicator that NYC simply didn’t follow the new definition until 2014. Figure 3.9: The annual number of rapes reported in New York City, 2000-2018. Less clear is what’s happening in San Francisco, California, shown in Figure 3.10. Here we do see an increase in 2013 which while it appears small on the graph is actually a 49% increase from 2012. Then there is a much larger spike in 2014 - a 120% increase - which may suggest that part of the agency started following the new definition in 2013 and the remainder followed in 2014. However, large increases or decreases are relatively common in San Francisco so it could also be that the agency only switched to the new definition in 2014 and the spike in 2013 is just a coincidence. Figure 3.10: The annual number of rapes reported in San Francisco, California, 2000-2018. Finally, we’ll look at Jackson Police Department in Mississippi where the definition change seems to have had no effect. As seen in Figure 3.11, reported rapes start to undulate in 2010 with 2013 data perfectly in line with the before and after trends - no sign that there is a change in reporting. This suggests that Jackson simply did not follow the definition change and continues to report using the old definition. Figure 3.11: The annual number of rapes reported in Jackson, Mississippi, 2000-2018. My takeaway from this is that rape should not be used at all for years after 2012. While the definition change makes pre-2013 and 2013+ years non-comparable, the differences in agency responses to this change - i.e. if they follow the rules or not - is such a mess that the data is too flawed to use. 3.4.2 The decline of manslaughter This data contains two different crime subcategories for homicide: murder and non-negligent manslaughter, and manslaughter by negligence. The first is our measure of murder, and it includes everything we traditionally think of when it comes to murder - shootings, stabbings, strangulation, basically any intentional killing of another person.30 Suicides, killing a fetus, and accidental killings (e.g. car crashes) are not considered murders.31 The second, manslaughter by negligence - usually called just “manslaughter” - is when someone kills another person through “gross negligence” but does not kill them intentionally. This can include accidental killings when the death was caused by gross negligence. The FBI provide examples of this as kids playing with guns and shooting each other (and not knowing the gun was loaded) or a hunter accidentally shooting someone while hunting. After the late 1970s this excludes deaths from traffic accidents caused by negligence, such as hit and runs or DUIs. However, prior to this, these deaths were included, which is the cause of the very high number of manslaughters in the 1960s and 1970s. Figure 3.12 shows the annual number of murders, manslaughter, and the sum of the two nationwide from 1960-2022. This just sums up the total reported counts from every agency each year so part of the increase is simply due to more agencies reporting as the year gets closer to the present day - so please pay attention to the diverging paths of each crime, not the trend for the individual crime over time. Murder is always more common than manslaughter but these values are not that far apart in the early decade of data and manslaughter doesn’t become rare until the end of the 1970s. Figure 3.12: The annual number of murder and non-negligent manslaughter, manslaughter by negligence, and the sum of the two, nationwide from 1960-2022. Figure 3.13 shows another way to look at this data: manslaughter as a percent of reported murder. In the early years of our data manslaughter was fairly common, with about 70-80% as many manslaughters reported as murders. This declined sharply in the mid-1960s until there were around 45% as many manslaughters as murders in the mid-1970s. Again this declined until it was about 4% in 1980, and it has remained around there ever since. As police behavior could reduce traffic fatalities - and arrests for DUIs and traffic tickets are designed to improve public safety - it is unfortunate the we no longer have data on traffic deaths. Figure 3.13: Reported manslaughter by negligence as a percent of reported murder and non-negligent manslaughter, nationwide 1960-2022.

Like other UCR datasets this is at the agency-month level so you can, for example, learn how often burglaries occur at the victim’s home during the day, and if that rate changes over the year or differs across agencies. The data, however, provides no information about the offender or the victim (other than if the victim was an individual or a commercial business [based on the location of the incident - “bank”, “gas station”, etc.]). The value of the property stolen is primarily based on the victim’s estimate of how much the item is worth (items that are decreased in value once used - such as cars - are supposed to be valued at the current market rate, but the data provides no indication of when it uses the current market rate or the victim’s estimate) so it should be used as a very rough estimate of value. Before getting into the details of this data, let’s look at one example of how this data can measure property crime in a few different ways. This data is highly useful to use as a rough measure of the cost of crime. This cost is limited to just the value of the property stolen - so excludes things like injuries, mental health effects of victimization, etc. - but is still better than nothing. Since this data includes, for some types of property stolen, both the number of offenses per month (broken down by type of theft and items stolen) and the value of the stolen property, we can also see if the average value of these thefts change over time. We’ll look at home burglaries that occur during the day in Philadelphia. First, we can look at the number of these kinds of burglaries each month or year. Figure 4.1 shows the annual number of daytime home burglaries and in recent years it has declined sharply into having the fewest on record in 2019. So citywide, Philadelphia has never been safer when it comes to daytime home burglaries. But when considering the cost of crime, we also want to know the actually monetary cost of that incident. This encompasses a lot of different values including physical and emotional harm to the victim (including harm to structures such as broken doors and windows) and changes in people’s behavior (e.g. quit job to avoid going to a certain part of town). With this data we only have the value of the physical items stolen, so while it is still a cost of crime it’s a rather shallow one. Figure 4.1: The annual number of daytime home burglaries reported in Philadelphia, PA, 1960-2022. Figure 4.2 measures this cost of crime by showing the annual sum of the value of the property stolen for daytime home burglaries in Philadelphia. The trend here is different than the previous graph which showed undulations in the number of burglaries but not major trend changes until the 2010s; here is a steady increase over the long term, though with varying speed of increase, until it peaked in the late 2000s/early 2010s before declining substantially in recent years. While the number of burglaries peaked in the early 1980s, the total value of burglaries didn’t peak until the early 2010s, so the cost of this crime (even this very narrow measure of cost) can’t be ascertained from knowing the number of burglaries alone. From this measure we can say that daytime home burglaries were worse in the early 2010s and are substantially better currently. Figure 4.2: The total annual cost of daytime home burglaries in Philadelphia. The final way we can measure daytime home burglaries is to put the previous variables together to look at the cost per burglary. This will give us the average amount of property stolen from each burglary victim. Figure 4.3 shows the cost average cost per burglary for each year of data available. Now we have a different story than the other graphs. Even though the number of daytime home burglaries declined substantially over the last decade and the total cost is around the level seen in the 1980s, the cost per burglary remains at record highs in recent years, though down from the peak in the mid-2010s. This suggests that while burglaries are down, the burden on each burglary victim has continued to grow. Figure 4.3: The annual number of burglaries and cost per burglary for daytime home burglaries in Philadelphia, 1960-2022. Part of this - and part of the long-term increase seen in Figure 4.2 - is simply due to inflation. $1 in 1963, the first year we have data on the value of burglaries, is worth $8.28 in 2019, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The values in this data are not adjusted for inflation so you need to do that adjustment yourself before any analyses, otherwise your results will be quite a bit off. When we adjust all values to 2019 dollars, as shown in Figure 4.4, the trend becomes changes a bit. There’s still a steady increase in cost per burglary over time but it is far more gradual than in Figure 4.3. And now the difference from the cost in early years and late years are far smaller. #&gt; Generating URL to request all 296 results #&gt; Retrieving inflation data for US #&gt; Generating URL to request all 64 results #&gt; Generating URL to request all 296 results #&gt; Retrieving inflation data for US #&gt; Generating URL to request all 64 results Figure 4.4: The inflation-adjusted annual number of burglaries and cost per burglary for daytime home burglaries in Philadelphia, 1960-2022. 4.1 Agencies reporting We’ll start by looking at which agencies report. The data is available from 1960 through 2019 though the columns about the value of the property only begin in 1964. Figure 4.5 show the number of agencies each year that reported at least one month during that year. In the first several years of data barely any agencies reported data and then it spiked around 1966 to over 6,000 agencies per year then grew quickly until over 12,000 agencies reported data in the late 1970s. From here it actually gradually declined until fewer than 12,000 agencies in the late 1990s before reversing course again and growing to about 15,000 agencies by 2019 - down several hundred agencies from the peak a few years earlier. Figure 4.5: The annual number of police agencies that report at least month of data that year. Since this data is called the “Supplement to Return A” we would expect that the agencies that report here are the same as the ones that report to the Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest data, which is also called the Return A dataset. Figure 4.6 shows the percent of agencies in this dataset that are also in the Return A data. Except for the first several years of data in the 1960s, we can see that most years have nearly all agencies reporting to both, though this has declined in recent years. Since the late 1970s over 90% of agencies that report to the Offenses Known data also report to this dataset. Figure 4.6: The percent of agencies in the Supplement to Return A data that are also in the Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest (Return A) data in that year, 1960-2022. 4.2 Important variables This data can really be broken into two parts: the monthly number of property (including robbery) crimes that occur that are more detailed than in the Offenses Known data, and the value of the property stolen (and recovered) from these crimes.33 For each category I present the complete breakdown of the available offenses/items stolen and describe some of the important issues to know about them. Like other UCR data, there are also variables that provide information about the agency - ORI codes, population under jurisdiction - the month and year that the data covers, and how many months reported data. 4.2.1 A more detailed breakdown of property (and robbery) crimes The first part of this data is just a monthly (or yearly in the annual data that I’ve released - the FBI, however, only releases data monthly so I just aggregated the months together) number of crimes of each type reported to the police (and that a police investigation discovered actually happened. For more on this process, please see Chapter 3.3.1). There are six crimes and their subsets included here: burglary, theft, robbery, and motor vehicle theft. The remaining two are rape and murder, but they don’t break down these crimes into any subcategories and are only available starting in 1974. Burglary is reported based on whether the building burgled was the victim’s residence or not, and also the time of the burglary. Time is either during the day (6am-5:59pm) or night (6:pm-5:59am) or if the time is unknown. Data is available since 1960 for both the day and night burglaries, but only since 1964 for the unknown time burglaries. For robbery, the subcategories are based on where the robberies occurred such as if it happened in a bank, a gas station, or a street. Theft is divided into two groups. The first group is based on the value of items stolen: less than $50, $50-$199, and $200 and up. The second group of thefts is broken into the type of theft such as a shoplifting or stealing from someone’s car. All theft variables begin in 1960 other than thefts from a coin machine and from a building which start in 1964 and the miscellaneous “All other thefts” variable that has data starting in 1961. Finally, motor vehicle theft is broken into where the stolen vehicle was stolen and found: stolen in the reporting agency’s jurisdiction and found by the same agency, stolen in the reporting agency’s jurisdiction and found by a different agency, and stolen in a different agency’s jurisdiction and found by the reporting agency. The complete list of each subsection and a brief definition for the non-obvious ones are presented below. Burglary Home/residence during the day (6:00am - 5:59pm) Home/residence during the night (6:00pm - 5:59am) Home residence at unknown time Non-residence (i.e. all buildings other than victim’s home) during the day (6:00am - 5:59pm) Non-residence (i.e. all buildings other than victim’s home) during the night (6:00pm - 5:59am) Non-residence (i.e. all buildings other than victim’s home) at unknown time Theft/larceny (excluding of a motor vehicle) &lt;$50 $50-$199 $200 and up Pick pocket Purse snatching Shoplifting Stealing from a car (but not stealing the car itself) Stealing parts of a car, such as the car battery or the tires Stealing a bicycle Stealing from a building where the offender is allowed to be in (and is not counted already as shoplifting) Stealing from a “coin operated machine” which is mainly vending machines All other thefts Robbery Highway - This is an old term to say a place is outside and in generally accessible and visible areas. This includes robberies on public streets and alleys. Commercial building - This is robberies in a business other than ones stated below. Includes restaurants, stores, hotels, bars. Gas station Chain/convenience store - a neighborhood store that generally is open late and sells food Home/residence Bank Miscellaneous/other - This is all other robberies not already covered. Motor vehicle theft Stolen in current agency’s jurisdiction and found by that agency Stolen in current agency’s jurisdiction and found by another agency Stolen in another agency’s jurisdiction and recovered by current agency Murder Rape 4.2.2 The value of property stolen in property (and robbery) crimes The next set of variables is the value of the property stolen in each crime, as well as the value of property stolen broken down by the type of property (e.g. clothing, electronics, etc.). To be clear, this is only the value of the property stolen during the crime. The cost of any injuries (mental or physical) or any lasting cost to the victim, their family, and society for these crimes are not included. This, of course, vastly underestimates the cost of these crimes so please understand that while this is a measure of the cost of crime, it is only a narrow slice of the true cost. The cost is the cost for the victim to replace the stolen item. So the current market price for that item (though factoring in the current state the item is in, e.g. if it’s already damaged) and, for businesses, the cost to buy that item and not the cost they sell it for. While the police can ask the victim how much the property was worth, they aren’t required to use the exact amount given as victims may exaggerate the value of items. This is not an exact science, so I recommend only interpreting these values as estimates - and potentially rough estimates. The value of the property stolen is broken into two overlapping categories: by crime type, and by type of property that was stolen. These are the exact same categories as covered in Section 4.2.1 but now is the dollar amount of the items stolen from those types of crimes. The second group is what type of items, based on several discrete categories, was stolen. Please note that multiple items can be stolen in each category - i.e. there is no Hierarchy Rule used here (for more in the Hierarchy Rule that is used in other UCR data, please see Section 3.1.1). And it counts the property stolen for each crime type as well as for each item type. So if you sum up all of the crime variables and all of the item type variables together you’ll overcount the value of property stolen. Each of the item types and their definitions - some categories include or exclude things that you may not expect them to - are detailed below. Though this data starts in 1960, not all variables are available then. 1963 and 1964 saw many new variables added - the values in these variables are reported as 0 in previous years - and in 1974 and 1975 even more variables are added. In 1963 the value of burglaries where the time of the burglary was known, thefts broken down into categories based on the value of property taken, thefts of car parts, theft from cars, shoplifting, and “other” thefts was added to the data. In the following year this data began including the value of property stolen from burglaries where the time of the burglary was unknown was added as well as thefts of bicycles, from “coin operated machines” (i.e. vending machines), purse snatching, and pick pocketing. The value of property stolen during rapes and murders was first reported in 1974. Finally, 1975 was the last year with new variables, with this year including consumable goods, stolen guns, household goods, livestock, office equipment and electronics, and sound and picture equipment. Burglary Home/residence during the day (6:00am - 5:59pm) Home/residence during the night (6:00pm - 5:59am) Home residence at unknown time Non-residence (i.e. all buildings other than victim’s home) during the day (6:00am - 5:59pm) Non-residence (i.e. all buildings other than victim’s home) during the night (6:00pm - 5:59am) Non-residence (i.e. all buildings other than victim’s home) at unknown time Murder Rape Robbery Highway - This is an old term to say a place is outside and in generally accessible and visible areas. This includes robberies on public streets and alleys. Commercial building - This is robberies in a business other than ones stated below. Includes restaurants, stores, hotels, bars. Gas station Chain/convenience store - a neighborhood store that generally is open late and sells food Home/residence Bank Miscellaneous/other - This is all other robberies not already covered. Theft/larceny (excluding of a motor vehicle) Pick pocket Purse snatching Shoplifting Stealing from a car (but not stealing the car itself) Stealing parts of a car, such as the car battery or the tires Stealing a bicycle Stealing from a building where the offender is allowed to be in (and is not counted already as shoplifting) Stealing from a “coin operated machine” which is mainly vending machines All other thefts Currency This includes all money and signed documents that can be exchanged for money (e.g. checks). Blank checks and credit and debit cards are not included (they are in the Miscellaneous/other category) Jewelry and “precious metals” Only metals that are considered high value are included here. Metals that are generally worth little are counted in the Miscellaneous/other category. Clothing and fur This also includes items that you take with you when leaving the house (except for your phone): wallet, shoes, purse, backpacks. Motor vehicle stolen in current agency’s jurisdiction This includes only vehicles than can be driven on wheels so excludes trains and anything on water or that can fly. Office equipment and electronics This includes “typewriters” and “magnetic tapes” but is essentially any kind of equipment needed to run a business. So printers, computers, cash registers, computer equipment like a monitor or a mouse, and computer software. These items do not have to be stolen from a commercial building to be included in this category. Sound and picture equipment This is a kind of odd category that is a product of its time. Anything that produces noise or pictures (including the fancy motion pictures) is included. This includes TVs, cameras, projectors, radios, MP3 players (but not phones that can play music) and (since again, this is a very old dataset) VHS cassettes. Guns This includes all types of firearms other than toys or BB/pellet/paintball guns. Home furniture This includes all of the “big things” in a house: begs, chairs, AC units, washer/dryer units, etc. However, items that are in the “Office equipment and electronics” category do not apply. Consumable goods This is anything that can be consumed such as food, drinks, and drugs, or anything you use in the bathroom. Livestock This is all animals other than ones that you would consider a pet Miscellaneous/other Anything that is not part of the above categories would fall in here. Cell phones and credit cards are included. 4.2.3 Value of recovered property by type of item stolen For the below subset of items stolen, this data includes the value of the items that were recovered. This is a subset of the section above - the value of property stolen. I don’t know why but this data has more values for the property stolen than for property recovered. For example, we know how much was stolen during bank robberies but not how much was recovered from bank robberies. The only info we have for the value of recovered property is for the breakdown in the items themselves - not breakdowns of crimes such as robbery or burglary. So we can know the value of guns recovered, but not if those guns were taken from a burglary, a robbery, a theft, etc. While this dataset began in 1960, the recovered property variables begin later, and in different years. For clothing and fur, currency, jewels and precious metals, motor vehicles, miscellaneous/other, and the variable that sums up all of the recovered property variables, the first year with data was 1961. The remaining variables - consumable goods, guns, household goods/home furniture, livestock, office equipment and electronics, and sound and picture equipment - began in 1975. Another issue is that it uses the value of the property as it is recovered, not as it is stolen. For example, if someone steals a laptop that’s worth $1,000 and then the police recover it damaged and it’s now worth only $200, we’d see $1,000 for the stolen column for “office equipment and electronics” and only $200 for the recovered column for that category. So an agency that recovers 100% of the items that were stolen can appear to only recover a fraction of them since the value of recovered items could be substantially lower than the value of stolen items - and there’s no way to know how many items are actually recovered, we must rely on the value of stolen and recovered.34 The full list of items recovered and their definitions are below: Currency This includes all money and signed documents that can be exchanged for money (e.g. checks). Blank checks and credit and debit cards are not included (they are in the miscellaneous/other category) Jewelry and “precious metals” Only metals that are considered high value are included here. Metals that are generally worth little are counted in the miscellaneous/other category. Clothing and fur This also includes items that you take with you when leaving the house (except for your phone): wallet, shoes, purse, backpacks. Motor vehicle stolen in current agency’s jurisdiction This includes only vehicles than can be driven on wheels so excludes trains and anything on water or that can fly. Office equipment and electronics This includes “typewriters” and “magnetic tapes” but is essentially any kind of equipment needed to run a business. So printers, computers, cash registers, computer equipment like a monitor or a mouse, and computer software. These items do not have to be stolen from a commercial building to be included in this category. Sound and picture equipment This is a kind of odd category that is a product of its time. Anything that produces noise or pictures (including the fancy motion pictures) is included. This includes TVs, cameras, projectors, radios, MP3 players (but not phones that can play music) and (since again, this is a very old dataset) VHS cassettes. Guns This includes all types of firearms other than toys or BB/pellet/paintball guns. Household goods/Home furniture This includes all of the “big things” in a house: begs, chairs, AC units, washer/dryer units, etc. However, items that are in the “Office equipment and electronics” category do not apply. Consumable goods This is anything that can be consumed such as food, drinks, and drugs, or anything you use in the bathroom. Livestock This is all animals other than ones that you would consider a pet Miscellaneous/other Anything that is not part of the above categories would fall in here. Cell phones and credit cards are included. 4.3 Data errors This dataset comes with a considerable number of data errors - basically enormous valuations for stolen property. Some of the values are so big that it is clearly an error and not just something very expensive stolen. However, this gets tricky since there can in fact simply be very expensive items stolen and make it look like an error. Some of the stolen property include variables for both the number of items of that type stolen and the total value of the items. From this we can make an average value per item stolen which can help our understanding of what was stolen. However, some items only have the value of the property stolen and the value of property recovered so we actually don’t know how many of those items were stolen. These cases make it even harder to believe that a large value is true and not just a data error since we don’t know if the number of these thefts increased, causing the increase in the value reported. We’ll look at a couple examples of this and see how difficult it can be to trust this data. First, we’ll look at the value of livestock thefts in New York City. Livestock is one of the variables where we know the value stolen and recovered but not how many times it happened. Being a major urban city, we might expect that there are not many livestock animals in the city so the values should be low. Figure 4.7 shows the annual value of livestock thefts in NYC. There are two major issues here. First, in all but two years they report $0 in livestock thefts. This is likely wrong since even New York City has some livestock (even just the police horses and the horse carriages tourists like) that probably got stolen. The second issue is the massive spike of reported livestock theft value in 1993 with over $15 million stolen (the only other year with reported thefts is 1975 with $87,651 stolen). Clearly NYC didn’t move from $0 in thefts for decades to $15 million in a year and then $0 again so this is a blatant data error. Figure 4.7: The annual value of stolen livestock in New York City, 1960-2022. It gets harder to determine when a value is a mistake when it is simply a big spike - or drop - in reported value in a dataset that otherwise looks correct. Take, for example, the annual value of stolen clothing and fur in Philadelphia from 1960-2022, shown in Figure 4.8. The annual value of these stolen items more than doubled in 1989 compared to the previous year and then declined rapidly in the following year. Is this real? Is it a data error? It’s really hard to tell. Here we don’t know how many clothing/fur thefts there were, only the value of the total thefts that month (which is aggregated annually here). It continues a multi-year trend of increasing value of thefts but it larger than previous increases in value. And while the spike is very large in percent terms, it’s not so extraordinarily huge that we immediately think it’s an error - though some outlier detection methods may think so if it’s beyond the expected value for that year. It’s also important to have some understanding of what the data should look like when trying to figure out what data point may be incorrect. In this figure we see a huge spike in 1989. If we know, for example, that a ring of fur thieves were active this year, then that makes it far more likely that the data is real. This may be a rather odd example, but it is helpful to try to understand the context of the data to better understand when the “weird” data is an error and when it’s just “weird but correct”. Figure 4.8: The annual value of stolen clothing and fur in Philadelphia, PA, 1960-2022 It also includes the value of items stolen during rapes and murders, if anything was stolen.↩︎ I’m really not sure why this data isn’t just merged with the Offenses Known data, especially the first part where it’s just counts of crimes.↩︎ Even if we look at the Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest data, that only says if there was an arrest or exceptional clearance in the case, not if the property stolen was recovered↩︎ "],["arrests.html", "Chapter 5 Arrests by Age, Sex, and Race 5.1 Agencies reporting 5.2 What is an arrest? (what unit is this data in?) 5.3 Crimes included 5.4 Important variables", " Chapter 5 Arrests by Age, Sex, and Race The Arrests by Age, Sex, and Race dataset - often called ASR, or the “arrests data”, or sometimes the “Arrests by Age, Sex, Race, and Ethnicity (ASRE) though this is really misleading since most years don’t even report ethnicity data - includes the monthly number of arrests for a variety of crimes and, unlike the crime data, breaks down this data by age and gender. This data includes a broader number of crime categories than the crime dataset (the Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest data) though is less detailed on violent crimes since it does not breakdown aggravated assault or robberies by weapon type as the Offenses Known data does. For each crime it says the number of arrests for each gender-age group with younger ages (15-24) showing the arrestee’s age to the year (e.g. age 16) and other ages grouping years together (e.g. age 25-29, 30-34,”under 10”). It also breaks down arrests by race-age by including the number of arrestees of each race (American Indian, Asian, Black, and White are the only included races) and if the arrestee is a juvenile (&lt;18 years old) or an adult. The data does technically include a breakdown by ethnicity-age (e.g. juvenile-Hispanic, juvenile-non-Hispanic) but almost no agencies report this data (for most years zero agencies report ethnicity) so in practice the data does not include ethnicity. As the data includes counts of arrestees, people who are arrested multiple times are included in the data multiple times - it is not a measure of unique arrestees. 5.1 Agencies reporting This data is available from 1974 through 2019 and Figure 5.1 shows how many agencies reported at least one month of the year for each of these years. I’m not sure why there’s a dip in 1980. Since it immediately reverses itself in the next year I think it’s just a data issue, not a real decrease in the number of agencies that report. The first year of data has about 9,000 agencies reporting and that increases strongly to a little over 13,000 in 1979. Following the odd blip in 1980, the number of agencies remain steady for nearly a decade before declining to a local low of about 11,000 in 1998 before again increasing steadily until the end of our data where nearly 15,000 agencies report. This 15,000, however, still remains under the estimated 18,000 police agencies in the United States and below the reporting rates of UCR data such as the Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest data. This data is also missing some important cities such as New York City which hasn’t reported even a single month since 2002 and Chicago which tends to only report a single month if at all. Figure 5.1: The annual number of agencies reporting at least one month of data in that year. If we look at agencies that report all 12 months of the year, as seen in Figure 5.2, now far fewer agencies report. In almost every year about 45-55% of agencies that report at all report all 12 months. This means that we’re missing data for about half of agencies. When an agency reports at all, they tend to report more months than fewer. For example, there are about twice as many agency-years with 11 months reported than with only 1 month reported. So having only about half of agencies report all 12 months of the year doesn’t mean that we’re missing a ton of data from the remaining half of agencies - but does merit close attention to which agencies you use in your research and how much missingness there is for those agencies. Figure 5.2: The annual number of agencies reporting 12 months of data in that year. Another issue is that agencies can report only some crimes. So, for example, they may report how many people were arrested for theft but not for murder, and it’s unclear when that means that truly zero people were arrested for murder and when the agency just didn’t report. This isn’t in the original data but in my version of this data (available here), I added variables for the number of months reported (based on the agency reporting at least arrest for that crime in that year) for each crime category. Again, please note that when there are fewer than 12 months reported in that year for that variable, that could simply mean that there were no arrests for that crime that year (The FBI does tell agencies not to even submit a report in these cases) - but we don’t know that for sure. 5.2 What is an arrest? (what unit is this data in?) A key part of understanding this data is knowing what unit of analysis it’s in. This data is the monthly number of total arrests for a given crime, with only the most serious crime per incident included. Consider for example, a person who robs a bank, shooting and killing a guard and pointing their gun at other people in the bank. They are arrested and then released from jail (just imagine that this is true) and are rearrested the next day for shoplifting. And let’s further assume that both arrests were in the same month in the same agency. How many arrests are here? They committed multiple crimes in the first incident (murder, robbery, aggravated assault) but in this dataset they would only be classified as an arrest for the most serious crime, murder. And then separately they’d also be an arrested for shoplifting. So assuming that no other arrests occurred in that police agency that month, there would be two arrests reported: one for murder and one for shoplifting. There’s no way to tell how many unique people were arrested, or of those arrested multiple times which crimes they were arrested for. So if you have 100 arrests there may be 1 person arrested 100 times or 100 people arrested once - though, of course, the true number is likely somewhere in between. This means that studies that try to use this data as a measure of unique people or even the percent of arrestees by group (age, gender, or race) relative to some base rate of the population such as the number of people living in that city are going to be wrong - though how wrong is unclear.35 Common uses of this data - more common in more news articles or advocacy group reports than in peer-reviewed research articles - compare the percent of arrestees of a certain group to the percent of a city’s population of that group. Any differences between the arrestee percent and the resident percent is, according to these reports, evidence of a disparity (this is most common for looking at differences by race). Since these analyses are generally looking at annual data, it assumes that people of each group (usually they look at race but gender and age data is also available) are rearrested at the same rate. That is, White people, for example, are rearrested in the same year for the same crime at the exact same rate as Black people. If not, then you’re be comparing different things since one group would have more overall people arrested while the other would have fewer people but who are arrested more frequently. Whether this distinction between arrests and unique people arrested affects your interpretation of the data depends on the study you are doing, but it’s important to consider in your research. One way to address this is to use other data on the rate of rearrest by group, though you’d have to be very careful to not extrapolate the results of the other study too far beyond what they could tell you of the specific time and place they studied. 5.2.1 The Hierarchy Rule In incidents where the arrestee commits multiple crimes, this data uses something called the Hierarchy Rule which says that only the most serious crime is counted as the crime that the person was arrested for. For a comprehensive overview of the Hierarchy Rule, please see Section 3.1.1. Basically, the FBI chose seven crimes in 1929 that they call Index Crimes - or sometimes called Part I crimes - and these were considered the most important crimes to be recorded. For more on Index Crimes, please see Section 3.1. If a person is arrested for multiple crimes and an Index Crime is one of those crimes, then the Index Crime at the top of the Hierarchy is the one recorded in this data. Section 5.3 shows all crimes included and the crimes 1-7 as well as 9 (arson) are the Index Crimes. The top of the Hierarchy is the crime with the lowest number. So murder is always reported in incidents where there’s a murder; rape is always reported when there’s an incident with rape but no murder; etc. In incidents where the arrestee committed both an Index Crime and a Part II crime, then only the top Index Crime is recorded. This can lead to rather silly results since some Part II crimes are certainly more serious than some Index Crimes. Consider, for example, a person arrested for simple assault, carrying a firearm, pimping, and of theft. The first three crimes are, in my opinion, clearly more serious than theft. But since theft is an Index Crime, this person would be considered to have been arrested for theft. The remaining crimes are called Part II crimes and are not arranged in any particular way. So a lower value numbered crime is not higher on the Hierarchy than a higher value number - Part II crimes don’t follow the Hierarchy. If all of the crimes in an incident are Part II crimes then the agency must decide for themselves which crime is the most serious. This can lead to agencies deciding their own hierarchy differently than others which makes this data much less comparable across agencies than if there was a standard rule. 5.3 Crimes included Homicide Murder and non-negligent manslaughter Manslaughter by negligence Rape Robbery Aggravated assault Burglary Theft (other than of a motor vehicle) Motor vehicle theft Simple assault Arson Forgery and counterfeiting Fraud Embezzlement Stolen property - buying, receiving, and possessing Vandalism Weapons offenses - carrying, possessing, etc. Prostitution and commercialized vice Sex offenses - other than rape or prostitution Drug abuse violations - total Drug sale or manufacturing Opium and cocaine, and their derivatives (including morphine and heroin) Marijuana Synthetic narcotics Other dangerous non-narcotic drugs Drug possession Opium and cocaine, and their derivatives (including morphine and heroin) Marijuana Synthetic narcotics Other dangerous non-narcotic drugs Gambling - total Bookmaking - horse and sports Number and lottery All other gambling Offenses against family and children - nonviolent acts against family members. Includes neglect or abuse, nonpayment of child support or alimony. Driving under the influence (DUI) Liquor law violations - Includes illegal production, possession (e.g. underage) or sale of alcohol, open container, or public use laws. Does not include DUIs and drunkenness. Drunkenness - i.e. public intoxication Disorderly conduct Vagrancy - includes begging, loitering (for adults only), homelessness, and being a “suspicious person.” All other offenses (other than traffic) - a catch-all category for any arrest that is not otherwise specified in this list. Does not include traffic offenses. Very wide variety of crimes are included - use caution when using! Suspicion - “Arrested for no specific offense and released without formal charges being placed.” Curfew and loitering law violations - for minors only. Runaways - for minors only. 5.4 Important variables This data has the standard set of variables describing the agency that is reporting. This includes the agency ORI - which is the unique ID for that agency - the agency name, their state, the population under their jurisdiction, and the month and year of the data. For each crime this data provides the number of arrests in that month (or year for the annual data) broken down by age (within this, by gender), by race (within this, by if they are a juvenile or an adult), and by ethnicity though this is an enormously flawed variable. Finally, we also know the number of juvenile arrests that ended in a few possible outcomes, though we don’t know the crime that led to these arrests. We’ll get into each of these variables below. 5.4.1 Age For each crime the data provides the number of people of each gender by age, with several years in the peak offending age given as the specific age and younger and older ages broken into groups. Only female and male genders are available, and there is no variable for “unknown” gender. So to get a total arrests for that crime for that age, just add the female and male variables together. Below are the ages or age categories included in the data, and these are the same for female and male arrestees. Female Under 10 10-12 13-14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25-29 30-34 35-39 40-44 45-49 50-54 55-59 60-64 65 and older Male Under 10 10-12 13-14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25-29 30-34 35-39 40-44 45-49 50-54 55-59 60-64 65 and older One way to use this data is to look at the age-crime curve of offending. The age-crime curve is a criminological finding that crime trends to grow in the early teenage years to peaking around age 18 before declining sharply. So essentially people commit crime as teenagers and then tend to fizzle out as they get older. Figure 5.3 shows this trend for male arrestees of rape in Philadelphia from 1974-2022, which is every year of data we have available. A major problem with this figure is that some of the ages are for single years and some are for age categories. In the graph there were 748 arrests for rape for people aged 24. The next age is the category of aged 25-29 and there were 3,442 arrests for this age group. One way to address this is to assume that each age in the category has the same number of arrests, so dividing 3,442 by 5 gives us about 688 arrests per age. Assuming equal arrests by age, however, is not consistent with either the literature on the age-crime curve or the findings in this figure for previous ages, as the number of arrests by age is, overall, going down since age 18. So instead of assuming equality, would we assume that older ages have fewer arrests than younger ages (maybe taking the percent change from the previous years where we do have individual ages available)? This is a tricky question to answer and it makes these kinds of analyses really hard to do - and very imprecise since all of your assumptions will be wrong, though hopefully not too wrong. Figure 5.3: The total number of rapes by male arrestees reported by arrestee age in Philadelphia, 1974-2022. 5.4.2 Race The data also breaks down the number of arrests for each crime by race, with the only included races being American Indian, Asian, Black, and White. This is further broken down into if the arrestee was an adult (18 years or older) or a juvenile (under 18). Whether the arrestee is Hispanic is in a separate (and nearly universally non-reported variable). Since the ethnicity variable is separate, and since the data is not at the arrestee-level unit, there’s no way to interact the race and ethnicity variables. So, for example, there is no way to determine how many White-Hispanic or White-Non-Hispanic arrestees. Just total White arrestees and total Hispanic arrestees. As with race variables in other UCR datasets - and, really, any dataset - you should be cautious about using this variables since it is the officer’s perception of the arrestee’s race - though of course some arrests do have other data about the arrestee’s race such as what they tell the officer. Even though there is information about the specific age of arrestee (or the age range, depending on the arrestee’s age) and their gender, there is no gender information combined with race and no age beyond the adult/juvenile binary. If you add up all arrests that are broken down by gender-age and compare it to the sum of all of the arrests broken down by adult/juvenile-race here, in some cases these numbers don’t add up. That’s because while most agencies do report the age variables, not all agencies report the race variables. So summing up the race variables will actually undercount the total number of arrests. Adult American Indian Asian Black White Juvenile American Indian Asian Black White Figure 5.4 shows one example of an analysis of this data by showing the percent of arrests of adults for marijuana possession by the arrestee’s race in Philadelphia, PA for all years of data we have available, 1976-2022. At the bottom are American Indian and Asian arrestees who make up nearly none of the arrests for this crime. Black arrestees, shown in purple, make up the bulk of arrests with only a few years making up under 60% of arrests and growing to around 80% of arrests since the mid-2000s. As White arrestees, shown in black, are the only other race category included, they make up a near perfect mirror image of Black arrestees, composing of around 40% of arrests until decreasing starting in the 1990s to end up with about 20% of arrests in recent years. Figure 5.4: The annual percent of adult marijuana possession arrests in Philadelphia by arrestee race, 1976-2022. Interestingly, while the disparity between Black-White arrests has grown dramatically in recent decades, the total number of arrests have a very different trend as shown in Figure 5.5. Total marijuana possession arrests declined in the mid-1980s then increased in the mid-1990s from only a few hundred arrests in the early 1990s to nearly 6,000 arrests in the late-2000s before dropping precipitously to about 700 each year in the late-2010s. Yet throughout this latter period as a percent of arrests, Black people consistently grew for years before plateauing around 2007 with a small decline in the last few years. Philadelphia decriminalized marijuana possession in 2014 under Mayor Nutter which is right when the steepest decline in arrests happened, though in the last couple of years also saw a decline in arrests. This suggests that who is arrested, in terms of race, is relatively unrelated to the total number of arrests, at least for marijuana. Figure 5.5: The annual number of adult marijuana possession arrests in Philadelphia by arrestee race, 1976-2022. 5.4.3 Ethnicity While technically included, the ethnicity variable is largely useless since for most years no agencies reported it and for the years where agencies do report ethnicity, not all agencies do so. The ethnicities included are Hispanic and non-Hispanic are broken down by if the arrestee is an adult (18+ years old) or a juvenile (&lt;18 years old). Adult Hispanic Non-Hispanic Juvenile Hispanic Non-Hispanic Figure 5.6 shows the annual number of Hispanic arrestees for theft for all agencies that reported any data that year.36 For several years no agencies reported until the number of Hispanic arrestees start climbing in 1980 and peaks in 1986 at about 136,000 arrestees. Then there are zero Hispanic arrestees for a few years, four Hispanic arrestees in 1990, and then again zero Hispanic arrestees, this time for decades. Only in 2017 do the number of Hispanic theft arrestees begin to creep up. From 2017 to 2019 (the last year available at the time of this writing) there are Hispanic arrestees reported every year, though now only about 30,000 per year. Figure 5.6: The national annual number of Hispanic arrestees for theft. This includes all agencies that year that reporting any number of months. Hispanic arrestees include both juvenile and adult arrestees Perhaps a better way to look at this data is to see what percent of agencies report ethnicity data. Figure 5.7 show the percent of agencies each year that report at least one Hispanic or non-Hispanic (which are the only choices, but showing only Hispanic arrests would exclude agencies where no Hispanic people truly were arrested) arrest for theft, of all agencies that reported theft data. About 90-95% of agencies reported ethnicity data in the early 80s and then only a couple agencies report in 1990 and 1991. Other than those agencies, none report between 1987 and 2017. Starting in 2017, 36% of agencies report and this number has grown by about five percentage points a year to 46% in 2019. Since fewer than half of agencies currently report, I strongly recommend against using these variables, even for the recent years of data. Figure 5.7: The annual percent of agencies that report theft arrests that reported at least one Hispanic person or one non-Hispanic person arrested for theft. Arrestees include both juvenile and adult arrestees. 5.4.4 Juvenile referrals The final variable of interest are five mutually exclusive outcomes for juveniles who are arrested by the police for a crime that if they were adults would have been counted as a formal arrest. Unlike the rest of this dataset where juvenile is defined as being under the age of 18, these variables allow states to use their own definition of juvenile. So potentially the limit for who is a juvenile could be below the age of 18, and nothing in the data indicates when this is so - you’d have to check each state to see their definition and if it changed over time. There is no breakdown by crime so this gives you the outcomes for juveniles arrested for all crimes in that agency. Please note that the number of juveniles in other variables and the number here do not always line up, which is a mix of underreporting of this variable, arrests for other jurisdictions are not counted as an arrest in the above variables, and different age definitions for who is a juvenile. A juvenile may potentially get multiple referrals, such as being released and then later referred to court. But in this data only the initial referral is included. Below are the five potential outcomes and definitions of each: Handled within department and released Juvenile is arrested but then released without any formal charges. Generally released to adult relatives with a warning but no formal charge. Referred to juvenile court or probation department Referred to welfare agency Referred to other police agency This includes when the agency makes an arrest on behalf of a different agency, such as when the juvenile committed a crime in that different agency’s jurisdiction. People arrested in this category are also not included in the other variables for juvenile arrests (e.g. arrests by age) as that only includes people who committed a crime in the agency’s own jurisdiction. Referred to criminal or adult court These are juveniles who are referred to be tried in criminal court as adults. This is for states that allow juveniles to be tried as adults. This is the police’s recommendation that they be tried as adults, regardless of the decision of the district attorney or court for whether that juvenile is ultimately tried as an adult. We can look at an example of this in Figure 5.8 which shows the annual number of referral types in Philadelphia from 1974-2022. For all the first couple of years almost all of the referrals have either been that the agency handles the arrest internally and releases the juvenile without any formal charges, or that the juvenile is formally arrested and referred to juvenile court. This is a pretty consistent trend with those two categories being the predominant outcome for juveniles arrested in other agencies and over time. In most years handled internally is the most common outcome though juvenile court is occasionally more common, including in recent years. Figure 5.8: The annual number of juvenile referrals in Philadelphia by referral type, 1974-2022. While all studies are going to be estimates of the real effect, that’s no reason to be flippant in using data (UCR and other data). Without having a high level of confidence that your estimates are close to the actual value, you shouldn’t do that study.↩︎ Theft is used as it’s one of the most common crimes.↩︎ "],["shr.html", "Chapter 6 Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR) 6.1 Agencies reporting 6.2 Important variables", " Chapter 6 Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR) The Supplementary Homicide Reports dataset - often abbreviated to SHR - is the most detailed of the UCR datasets and provides information about the circumstances and participants (victim and offender demographics and relationship status) for homicides.37 For each homicide incident it tells you the age, gender, race, and ethnicity of each victim and offender as well as the relationship between the first victim and each of the offenders (but not the other victims in cases where there are multiple victims). It also tells you the weapon used by each offender and the circumstance of the killing, such as a “lovers triangle” or a gang-related murder. As with other UCR data, it also tells you the agency it occurred in and the month and year when the crime happened. 6.1 Agencies reporting This data only has a report when the agency has a murder that year and since murder is rare it is difficult to measure underreporting. One way we can look at reporting is to compare murders in the SHR data with that of other datasets. We’ll look at two of them: the Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest which is covered in detail in Chapter 3, and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data on national deaths from homicide.38 Both this dataset and the Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest data are UCR datasets so you may think that the numbers of murders from each dataset should be the same. That is a perfectly reasonable assumption, but since this is UCR data we’re talking about, you’d be wrong. Police agencies are free to report to either, both, or neither dataset so while the number of murders are close for each dataset, they are never equal. CDC WONDER data aggregates mortality data (among other data) from state death certificates which reduces the issue of voluntary reporting that we have in UCR data. Figure 6.1 shows the annual number of murder victims from each of these datasets starting in 1976 for the UCR data and in 1999 for the CDC data.39 For the UCR data, in every year the numbers are fairly similar and the trends are the same over time, but the number of murders is never equal. The numbers have actually gotten worse over time with the difference between the datasets increasing and the Offenses Known data having consistently more murders reported than the SHR data since the late 1990s. Compared to the CDC data, however, both UCR datasets - and in particular the SHR data - undercount the number of murders. While trends are the same, UCR data reports thousands fewer murders per year than the CDC data, indicating how much of an issue underreporting is in this data. Figure 6.1: The annual number of murders from the Supplementary Homicide Report and the Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest dataset. Numbers differ because agencies voluntarily report and may not report to both datasets. 6.2 Important variables The data has demographic information for up to 11 victims and 11 offenders, as well as the information on the weapon used by each offender, the relationship between the first victim and each offender, and the circumstance of the murder. The data also has the traditional UCR set of variables about the agency: their ORI code, population, state, region and the month and year of this data. One key variable that is missing is the outcome of the homicide: there is no information on whether any of the offenders were arrested. While there is information on up to 11 victims and offenders, in most cases, there is only a single victim and a single offender in each incident. To see how the breakdown for the number of victims in each incident looks, Figure 6.2 shows the percent of incidents with each possible number of victims.40 In nearly all incidents - 96.1% - there was only a single victim. This drops to 3.2% of incidents for two victims, 0.5% for three victims, and only about 0.2% of incidents have four or more victims. Figure 6.2: The percent of incidents from that have 1-11 victims. Figure 6.3 shows the breakdown of the number of offenders per homicide incident.41 It’s a little less concentrated than with victims but the vast majority of homicides are committed by one offender - or at least the police only report one offender. About 88% of homicides have only one offender, 8.2% have two, 2.4% have three, and fewer than 1% have four. Fewer than 0.5% of homicides have more than four offenders. However, this is all a bit misleading. In cases where there is no information about the offender, including how many offenders there is, the data simply says that there is a single offender. So the number of homicides with a single offender is an overcount while the number with more offenders is an undercount. Figure 6.3: The percent of incidents from that have 1-11 offenders. The variable “situation” says what type of victim-offender number combination the incident is - e.g. “multiple victims/single offender”, “single victim/multiple offenders”, etc. - and does indicate if the number of offenders is unknown (though curiously there are over 4,000 instances where the number of offenders is unknown but they still say there are two offenders) so you can use this variable to determine if the police don’t know how many offenders there is. You’re still limited, of course, in that the number of offenders is always what the police think there are, and they may be wrong. So use this variable - and anything that comes from it like the percent of offenders of a certain race - with caution. We’ll now look at a number of important variables individually. Since the data can potentially have 11 victims and 11 offenders - but in practice has only one each in the vast majority of cases - we’ll only look at the first victim/offender for each of these variables. Therefore, the results will not be entirely accurate, but will still give you a good overview of the data. The figures below will use data for all homicides from 1976 to 2018 so will cover all but the most recent year of data. 6.2.1 Demographics There are two broad categories of variables that we’ll cover: demographics of the victim and offenders, and characteristics of the case. We start with demographics. 6.2.1.1 Age This data includes the age (in years) for each victim and each offender. For those under one years old, it also breaks this down into those from birth to six days old “including abandoned infant” and those seven days old to 364 days old. So there’s a bit more info on baby murders. It also maxes out the age at 99 so for victims or offenders older than that we don’t get their exact age, just text that says “99 years or older” (which I turn to the number 99 in the figures below). Figure 6.4 shows the percent of murders from where the first offender in the case is of each age from 0-99. Offenders with unknown ages are excluded from this graph and make up about 27% of cases. The average (mean) age is 30.9 years old (shown in orange) which is due to a long right tail; the median age is 28 years old. If you look closely at the left side of the graph you can see that there are some very young offenders, with at least one offender for each year of age from 0 to 10 included in the data. It’s not clear from this alone that these ages are a data entry error. While a two-year-old certainly couldn’t murder someone, the data does include deaths caused by “children playing with gun” (homicide circumstances will be discussed in Section 6.2.2.3) so these ages could potentially be correct. If you’re familiar with the age-crime curve in criminology - which basically says crime peaks in late teen years then falls dramatically - this shows that exact curve, though is older and doesn’t decline as the offender ages as quickly as we see with less serious crimes. Figure 6.4: The age of homicide offenders, based on the first offender in any homicide incident. Offenders under age 1 (classified as ‘birth to 7 days old, including abandoned infant’ and ‘7 days to 364 days old’) and considered 0 years old. Offenders reported as ‘99 years or older’ are considered 99 years old. Figure 6.5 repeats Figure 6.4 but with victim age rather than offender age. The mean victim age (shown in orange) is 32.9 and the median age is 30. Though the age victim age is a bit younger than the average offender age, trends are relatively similar for teenagers and older where deaths spikes in the late teen years and then declines steadily. The major difference is the U-shape for younger victims - for victims under age 15, homicides peak at age 0 (i.e. younger than their first birthday) with ~1.5% of all homicides being this this age. They then decline until plateauing at around age 6 before increasing again in the early teen years. Figure 6.5: The age of homicide victims, based on the first victims in any homicide incident. Victims under age 1 (classified as ‘birth to 7 days old, including abandoned infant’ and ‘7 days to 364 days old’) and considered 0 years old. Victims reported as ‘99 years or older’ are considered 99 years old. 6.2.1.2 Sex We’ll next look at victim and offender sex, a simple variable since only male and female are included. About 62% of offenders, as seen in Figure 6.6, are male and about 8% are female, indicating a large disparity in the sex of homicide offenders. The remaining 30% of offenders do not have sex data available because the police do not know the sex of this individual. For offenders who aren’t arrested, this variable may be inaccurate since it is perceived sex of the offender. Figure 6.6: The sex of offenders, . There is far less uncertainty for victim sex, with under 0.15% of victims having an unknown sex. Here again there is a large disparity between male and female with about 78% of victims being male and 22% being female. While there are more male victims than male offenders, this is probably just due to there being so many unknown offenders. Figure 6.7: The sex of victims, . 6.2.1.3 Race This data also includes the race of the victims and offenders. This includes the following races: American Indian or Alaskan Native, Asian, Black, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and White. These are the only races included in the data; Hispanic is considered an ethnicity and is available as a separate, though flawed, variable. There is no category for bi- or multi-racial. As with other demographics info for offenders, in cases where no arrest is made (and we don’t know in this data if one is made), there’s no way to confirm the person’s race (and race itself is hard to put into discrete boxes like done here) so these results may not be entirely accurate. Figure 6.8 shows the percent of homicides in the data by race. Black and White victims are included are similar percentages, at 34.2% and 33.8% of victims, respectively. The next most common group is Unknown at about 30.5% of offenders. Given that so many offenders have an unknown race, the reliability of the other race measures is limited. The remaining races are Asian at 0.9% of offenders, American Indian or Alaskan Native at 0.6%, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander at 0.004%. Figure 6.8: The race of offenders, . For victim race, seen in Figure 6.9, only about 1% of victim races are unknown. This means we can be a lot more confident in the race of the victims than in the race of the offender. Or, at least the challenge of categorizing people by race is the major problem, not missing data As with offenders, White and Black victims are the two most common races, with 49% and 47.7% of victims, respectively. There are almost double the percent of Asian victims than Asian offenders at 1.51% of victims (and 0.9% of offenders). American Indian or Alaskan Natives make up 0.8% of victims while Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islanders make up 0.005% of victims. Figure 6.9: The race of victims, 6.2.1.4 Ethnicity The final demographic variable is ethnicity which is whether the victim or offender is Hispanic or not Hispanic. The UCR data has a weird relationship with this variable (which is also in the Arrests by Age, Sex, and Race dataset, discussed in Chapter 5) where ethnicity is technically a variable in the data but very rarely collected. As such, this is an unreliable variable that if you really want to use needs careful attention to make sure it is being reported consistently by the agencies that you are looking at. The vast majority - 71.6% - of offenders have an unknown ethnicity while 21.5% are not Hispanic and 6.9% are Hispanic. Figure 6.10: The ethnicity of offenders, . Unlike the other demographic variables, there is still a huge amount of underreporting when it comes to victim ethnicity, though still less than for offender ethnicity. 59% of victims have an unknown ethnicity. Nearly 30% of victims are reported as not Hispanic while 10.8% are reported as Hispanic. Figure 6.11: The ethnicity of victims, . 6.2.2 Case characteristics 6.2.2.1 Weapon used The first variable we’ll look at is the weapon used by each offender. Table 6.1 shows the weapon used by the first offender in every incident from 1976 to 2018. Each offender can only be reported as having a single weapon, so this table essentially shows the number (and percent) of murders caused by this weapon. This isn’t entirely true since in reality an offender could use multiple weapons and there can be multiple offenders. In these cases the police include what they believe is the “primary” weapon used by this offender. The most commonly used weapon is a handgun, which is used in nearly half of murders. This is followed by a knife or other sharp weapon used to cut at 15% of murders, and then by “firearm, type not stated” which is just a firearm where we don’t know the exact type (it can include handguns) at 7.3% of murders. The fourth most common weapon is “personal weapons” at nearly 6% of murders. “Personal weapons” is a weird term to mean that there was no weapon - the “weapon” was the offender who beat the victim to death. Shotguns are involved in 5% of murders and all other weapons are involved in fewer than 5% of cases. In total there are 19 different weapons included though most are very uncommon. Table 6.1: The weapon used in a homicide incident. In cases where there are multiple offenders, shows only the primary weapon for the first offender. Weapon # of Incidents % of Incidents Handgun 388,178 49.06% Knife Or Cutting Instrument 115,540 14.60% Firearm, Type Not Stated 70,632 8.93% Personal Weapons - Includes Beating 45,473 5.75% Other Or Unknown Weapon 42,002 5.31% Shotgun 36,827 4.65% Blunt Object 34,716 4.39% Rifle 28,108 3.55% Strangulation - Includes Hanging 9,763 1.23% Fire 5,380 0.68% Asphyxiation - Includes Death By Gas 4,804 0.61% Other Gun 3,473 0.44% Narcotics/Drugs - Includes Sleeping Pills 3,144 0.40% Drowning 1,387 0.18% Other Or Type Unknown 586 0.07% Poison - Does Not Include Gas 531 0.07% Explosives 386 0.05% Pushed Or Thrown Out of Window 257 0.03% Narcotics Or Drugs 48 0.01% 35 1 0.00% Total 791,236 100% 6.2.2.2 Relationship between first victim and offenders An interesting and highly useful variable is the relationship between the first victim and each offender. To be clear, this is only for the first victim; we don’t have the relationship between other victims and offenders. However, as seen earlier, this isn’t too much of an issue since nearly all incidents only have a single victim. There are 29 possible relationship types (including “unknown” relationship) which are broken into three categories: legal family members, people known to the victim but who aren’t family, and people not known to the victim. Table 6.2 shows these relationships and the number and percent of murders with these relationships. If you’re looking at this on a computer you can sort or search through this table. The most common relationship, with a little over a third of murders, is that the police don’t know the relationship. So there is a good deal of uncertainty in the relationship between victims and offenders. Next is that the victim is the offender’s acquaintance at 20.5% or is a stranger at 15.5%. The next is “other - known to victim” which is similar to being an acquaintance at almost 5% of murders. The 5th most common relationship, at 3.65% is that the victim is the wife of the offender, so is murdered by her husband, and is the first familial relationship of this list. This is followed by the victim being the friend of the murderer at 3.62%. The remaining relationships all make up fewer than 3% of all murders. Table 6.2: The relationship between the first victim and the first offender in a homicide incident. Relationship Category # of Incidents % of Incidents Unknown 296,757 37.51% Acquaintance Not family (but known) 156,115 19.73% Stranger Not known 120,719 15.26% Other - Known To Victim Not family (but known) 37,899 4.79% Friend Not family (but known) 28,411 3.59% Wife Family 27,977 3.54% Girlfriend Not family (but known) 21,447 2.71% Husband Family 12,085 1.53% Other Family Family 11,760 1.49% Son Family 11,408 1.44% Boyfriend Not family (but known) 10,009 1.26% Neighbor Not family (but known) 8,081 1.02% Daughter Family 8,056 1.02% Brother Family 6,961 0.88% Father Family 5,667 0.72% Mother Family 5,274 0.67% In-Law Family 4,608 0.58% Common-Law Wife Family 3,317 0.42% Common-Law Husband Family 2,722 0.34% Ex-Wife Not family (but known) 2,365 0.30% Stepfather Family 1,864 0.24% Homosexual Relationship Not family (but known) 1,704 0.22% Sister Family 1,536 0.19% Stepson Family 1,500 0.19% Ex-Husband Not family (but known) 937 0.12% Stepdaughter Family 792 0.10% Employer Not family (but known) 564 0.07% Employee Not family (but known) 451 0.06% Stepmother Family 250 0.03% Total 791,236 100% 6.2.2.3 Homicide circumstance We also have information on the type of the murder, which this data calls the “circumstance”. This comes as relatively broad categories that leave a lot to be desired in our understanding of what led to the murder. Table 6.3 shows the number and percent of each circumstance for the first victim of each murder from 1976 to 2018. This data has 33 possible circumstances which it groups into four main categories: murders that coincide with committing another crime (“felony type” murders), murders that don’t coincide with another crime (“non-felony type” murders), justifiable homicides, and negligent manslaughter. The felony type murders are simply ones where another crime occurred during the murder. While this is called “felony type” it does include other crimes such as theft and gambling (which isn’t always a felony) so is a bit of a misnomer. The “non-felony type” are murders that happen without another crime. This includes gang killings (where, supposedly, only the murder occurred), children killed by babysitters, fights among intoxicated (both of alcohol and drugs) people, and “lover’s triangle” killings. Justifiable homicides are when a person (civilian or police officer) kill a person who is committing a crime.42 Negligent manslaughter includes accidental shootings such as when children find and shoot a gun, but excludes deaths from traffic accidents. The most common circumstances, accounting for 27.4%, 26.4%, and 12.5%, respectively, are “other arguments”, “unknown”, and “other non-felony type - not specified”. Since the data includes “argument over money or property” as one category, the “other arguments” mean that it’s an argument for a reason other than over money or property. The “other non-felony type” one does not mean that the murder did not occur alongside another crime, but also doesn’t fall into the non-felony categories included. Robbery is the only remaining circumstance with more than 5% of murders, at 8%. Table 6.3: The circumstance of the homicide for the first offender in a homicide incident. Circumstance Category # of Incidents % of Incidents Unknown 219,450 27.74% Other Arguments Non-Felony Type 212,941 26.91% Other Non-Felony Type - Not Specified Non-Felony Type 98,730 12.48% Robbery Felony Type 58,885 7.44% Narcotic Drug Laws Felony Type 28,360 3.58% Juvenile Gang Killings Non-Felony Type 24,309 3.07% Felon Killed By Police Justifiable Homicide 17,553 2.22% Other Felony Type - Not Specified Felony Type 15,460 1.95% Brawl Due To Influence of Alcohol Non-Felony Type 15,227 1.92% Argument Over Money Or Property Non-Felony Type 14,972 1.89% Felon Killed By Private Citizen Justifiable Homicide 13,928 1.76% All Suspected Felony Type Felony Type 12,975 1.64% All Other Manslaughter By Negligence Except Traffic Deaths Negligent Manslaughter 8,536 1.08% Domestic Violence (Historically Called Lovers Triangle/Quarrel) 6,431 0.81% Burglary Felony Type 6,356 0.80% Gangland Killings Non-Felony Type 5,809 0.73% Brawl Due To Influence of Narcotics Non-Felony Type 4,750 0.60% Lovers Triangle Non-Felony Type 4,158 0.53% Rape Felony Type 4,142 0.52% Other Negligent Handling of Gun Which Resulted In Death of Another Negligent Manslaughter 3,877 0.49% Arson Felony Type 3,304 0.42% Motor Vehicle Theft Felony Type 1,468 0.19% Children Playing With Gun Negligent Manslaughter 1,453 0.18% Other Sex Offenses Felony Type 1,433 0.18% Child Killed By Babysitter Non-Felony Type 1,342 0.17% Institutional Killings Non-Felony Type 1,262 0.16% Gambling Felony Type 1,040 0.13% Larceny Felony Type 916 0.12% Prostitution And Commercialized Vice Felony Type 626 0.08% Other - Not Specified Felony Type 554 0.07% Sniper Attack Non-Felony Type 480 0.06% Victim Shot In Hunting Accident Negligent Manslaughter 350 0.04% Gun Cleaning Death - Other Than Self-Inflicted Negligent Manslaughter 144 0.02% Abortion Felony Type 14 0.00% Human Trafficking/Commercial Sex Acts 1 0.00% Total 791,236 100% 6.2.2.4 Homicide subcircumstance The “subcircumstance” just tells you more information about justifiable homicides. This includes the circumstance leading up to the “felon” - which is how the person killed is described, though technically they don’t need to have committed a felony - was killed. It includes if this person attacked an officer (the one who killed them), a different officer, a civilian, or was committing or fleeing a crime. Table 6.4: The circumstance for the first offender in a homicide incident in cases where the offender is killed. This includes incidents where the only person who dies in the offender.

And second, it measures how many officers were assaulted or killed (including officers who die accidentally such as in a car crash) in a given month. The assault data is also broken down into shift type (e.g. alone, with a partner, on foot, in a car, etc.), the offender’s weapon, and type of call they are responding to (e.g. robbery, disturbance, traffic stop). The killed data simply says how many officers are killed feloniously (i.e. murdered) or died accidentally (e.g. car crash) in a given month. The employee information is at the year-level so you know, for example, how many male police officers were employed in a given year at an agency, but don’t know any more than that such as if the number employed changed over the year. This dataset is commonly used as a measure of police employees and is a generally reliable measure of how many police are employed by a police agency. The second part of this data, measuring assaults and deaths, is more flawed with missing data issues and data error issues (e.g. more officers killed than employed in an agency). 7.1 Agencies reporting Figure 7.1 shows the annual number of police agencies that reported at least one month that year. The first year of data available, 1960, has about 8,400 agencies reporting though this quickly drops to a trough of around 4,800 agencies that last for several years. After some undulations in the 1970s, reporting agencies steadily increases to nearly 14,000 agencies in the 1980s and remains steady until declining to around 12,000 by the late 1990s. Then reporting again steadily increases for the rest of our data to about 16,000 agencies by the end. Figure 7.1: The annual number of police agencies that report at least month of data that year, 1960-2022 7.2 Important variables The important variables can be divided into two sections: information on people employed by the department, and information about assaults against officers. The employee information is a snapshot in time during the year while the assault information tells you the number of assaults, broken down several different ways, for each month of the year. Like other UCR data, there are also variables that provide information about the agency - ORI codes, population under jurisdiction - the month and year that the data covers, and how many months reported data. 7.2.1 Number of employees This data includes the number of people employed by the department with breakdowns by if they are civilian employees or sworn officers (i.e. carries a gun and badge and can make arrests) as well as by gender. The only genders available are female and male. This is the number of employees as of Halloween that year so it is a single point in time. Though this helps us as it is consistent every year, we don’t know exactly when certain officer classes start, which we’d likely see through a jump in employment that year, or if employment or hiring patterns change over the year. Female employees Officers Civilians Male employees Officers Civilians We’ll look first at the number of employees that are civilian and that are sworn officers through examining Philadelphia in Figure 7.2. The number of civilian employees has remained at a little under 1,000 employees from about 1970 through the end of our data, though declining very slightly since the middle 2000s. This is curious since the city’s population and crime trends have changed dramatically over this time and the ability of civilian employees to contribute has also changed, such as that they now have computers.44 In contrast, the number of police has changed far more than civilians, growing rapidly in the 1960s and 1970s to peaking at a little over 8,000 officers in the mid-1970s before declining substantially to the 6,000s. in the late-1980s. As with many agencies nationwide, the number of officers increased in the 1990s and then has decreased steadily in ensuing years. By recent years there are about as many officers as in the late-1980s, even though the city’s population has grown substantially since then. Figure 7.2: The number of civilian employees and sworn officers in Philadelphia, 1960-2022 We can also look at the number of officers (or civilian employees) by gender. Figure 7.3 shows the percent of Philadelphia police officers by gender. For the first decade of data all female officers (or civilians) were recorded as male, so that variable should be interpreted as “total officers” until 1971 when it is split into gender. Starting at basically 0% of officers in 1971, female officers grew until they made up about a quarter of officers in 2000 and then has declined slowly since then. Figure 7.3: The percent of female and male sworn officers in Philadelphia, 1960-2022 7.2.2 Officers killed There is almost no information about officers killed. The data only breaks this down into if they died “feloniously” which just means that someone killed them on purpose (e.g. shooting them, intentionally hitting them with a car) or if they died “accidentally” such as if they die during a car crash while on duty. The FBI actually collects more information on officer deaths than they release in this data. This includes the circumstances of each death such as the type of death (e.g. car crash, shooting, ambush, etc.), what weapon the offender had if feloniously killed, and even a detailed written summary of what occurred for each officer killed. They post this information in their annual LEOKA report which is part of their Crime in the United States report. The 2019 report, the latest year available, can be found on their site here. We can look at what data is available through Figure 7.4 which shows the number of Los Angeles Police Department officers killed over time. There are no accidental killings until 1975 though this is misleading because that accidental killings variable is not reported until 1971, which is a year in which many other variables in this data began reporting. So we actually have no idea how many officers were killed accidentally from 1960-1970 since this variable is always reported as 0. In general it seems like there is about one officer killed per year in recent decades while the period from 1980 to 2000 was the time of highest danger with as many as five officers killed in a single year. We can also see some trend changes with felonious killings more common than accidental killings in the 1990s and then accidental killings becoming far more common starting in 2000. Figure 7.4: The number of officers killed by felony and killed accidentally in Los Angeles, 1960-2022 We can also look at the national number of officers killed as in Figure 7.5. Please note that this is simply summing up the number of officers killed by all agencies that report that year so changes over time are certainly partially due to different agencies reporting each year. Therefore, we’ll focus on interpreting the different between felony and accidental killings rather than counts over time - though even this may be off if agencies that reported more felony or more accidental killings differ in their reporting over time. Again we see that there are no officers killed accidentally, due to that variable not being reported, until 1971. The difference between officers killed by felony and killed accidentally is widest are the start of our data and narrows considerable until there are only several more felonious killings than accidental killings by the late 1990s. Though this trend reverses in the early 2010s with accidental killings decreasing and felonious killings increasing again. What can we make of this? It’s hard to say. Interpreting this properly requires adding some other key variables such as the number of officers employed, the number of circumstances they respond to (e.g. are they patrolling more, apprehending violent offenders more, etc.), the number of guns on the street, the quality or availability or body armor, among others. Figure 7.5: The national number of officers killed by felony and killed accidentally, 1960-2022 7.2.3 Assaults by injury and weapon This data breaks down the monthly number of assaults on officers in a few different ways. Here, we’ll look at the number of assaults where the officer is injured or not injured and within these categories by which weapon the offender had. This is the number of officers assaulted so if an incident has three officers assaulted, that will count as three different assaults. If the offender used multiple weapons then only the most serious weapon would be counted. For example, if an offender used a knife and a gun during the assault, the assault would be counted as a gun assault. Unfortunately we only know if an officer was injured or not and not the severity of the injury. So we can’t tell if the officer is merely bruised or was shot or stabbed. Assaults with injury Offender has firearm Offender had knife Offender had other weapon Offender was unarmed Assaults without injury Offender has firearm Offender had knife Offender had other weapon Offender was unarmed We can start by looking at the breakdown of assaults by injury and weapon type for officers in the Los Angeles Police Department. Figure 7.6 shows the number of assaults from all years reported for these categories. Over the complete time period there were almost 40,000 officers assaulted with about example three-quarters of these assaults - 30,000 assaults - leading to no injuries. This data shows the number of officers assaulted, not unique officers, so an officer can potentially be included in the data multiple times if they are assaulted multiple times. A little under a quarter of assaults lead to officer injury with most of these from unarmed offenders. Interestingly, there are far more gun and knife assaults where the officer is not injured than where the officer is injured. Figure 7.6: The total number of assaults on officers by injury sustained and offender weapon in Los Angeles, 1960-2022. We can also look at assaults over time. Figure 7.7 shows the number of assaults, assaults with injury, and assault without injury for the Los Angeles Police Department from 1960 to 2018. We can immediately see some data issues are there are years with no assaults recorded. And in the late-2000s there is a sudden drop from about 250 assaults with injuries per year in the previous few decades to nearly zero officer injuries reported a year. This strongly suggests some change in reporting rather than a true decrease in assaults with injuries. For the decades where the data is less obviously wrong, there is a consistent trend of most assaults leading to no injuries, though the distance between the number of injury and non-injury assaults fluctuates over time. Figure 7.7: The annual number of assaults on officers by injury sustained in Los Angeles, 1960-2022. 7.2.4 Assaults by call type The next group of ways that assaults are broken down is by the type of call the officer is assigned when they are assaulted. For example, if an officer is responding to a burglary report, any assault they experience on that call will be classified as “burglary” related. In addition, we know how many assaults were cleared by arrest or cleared through exceptional means (for more on this, please see 3.3.2) though it doesn’t differential between the two. Since assaults are based on the number of officers assaulted, not the number of incidents where officers are assaulted, arresting a single person can clear multiple assaults. The possible call types are below: Disturbance call (e.g. domestic violence, person carrying a gun in public) Burglary Robbery Officers arresting someone for another crime Civil disorder Officer has custody of prisoners Suspicious persons Officers are ambushed Mentally deranged person Traffic pursuit and traffic stops All other call types Total - sum of all call types Figure 7.8 shows the number of assaults on Los Angeles Police Department officers by the type of call for 1960-2022. There were about 38,000 assaults against Los Angeles Police Department officers with a little over 31,000 of these assaults cleared. An important thing to note is that the number of assaults here is less than the nearly 40,000 assaults for the same agency over the same time period we saw in Figure 7.8. This is because some variables are not reported for all years and agencies are free to report which variables they want to report in any given year. This makes it massively tricky to use this data since even simple statistics for the same agency for supposedly the same variable (here it’s technically different variables but should still be the total number of officers assaulted) can be different. The most common type of call where officers are assaulted are disturbance calls which include domestic violence and reports of dangerous individuals such as people carrying guns in public. The least common call type is ambush calls, though in these calls the police are called to a scene by the offender who intends to assault or kill the officers, so is likely far more dangerous than other call types, even though it is rare. Figure 7.8: Assaults on Los Angeles Police Department officers by type of call where they were assaulted at, 1960-2022. Within these call types is also a breakdown by offender weapon use, with the same weapons as above, and the type of officer assignment which is essentially if they are alone or not and if they’re on foot or not. Finally, it says how many assaults are cleared by arrest or cleared through exceptional means though it doesn’t differential between the two. The shift assignment is essentially how they go through their normal day, if this is in a vehicle, alone, as a detective, or under a different assignment (including being off-duty). For example, being in a vehicle with two officers means that their normal assignment is driving in a vehicle, not that they were actually assaulted in said vehicle. This also doesn’t necessarily mean that these are the only officers at the scene. It is simply the shift assignment of the officer who is assaulted. For example, if an officer who normally works alone in a vehicle shows up to a scene where other officers are present, and who are under different shift assignments, and gets assaulted - and no one else gets assaulted - that is an assault for officers “in a vehicle alone”. Offender weapons Offender has firearm Offender had knife Offender had other weapon Offender was unarmed Type of officer shift assignment In a vehicle with two officers In a vehicle alone In a vehicle alone but assisted by other officers Detective or special unit alone Detective or special unit assisted by other officers Other assignment alone Other assignment assisted by other officers Number of assaults on police cleared We’ll look specifically at disturbance calls since they are the most common call type, at least for the Los Angeles Police Department. Figure 7.9 shows the total number of disturbance assaults by offender weapon in Los Angeles. Most assaults have an unarmed offender with a sharp decline to the number of offenders with a weapon other than a gun or knife. Assaults by a gun and by a knife are the least common. Figure 7.9: The number of assaults on Los Angeles Police Department officers in disturbance calls by the injury sustained by the officer, 1960-2022. Again using disturbance calls for the Los Angeles Police Department, we can look at assaults by the officer assignment, as seen in Figure 7.10. In the vast majority of assaults it is of officers who are in a vehicle along with a partner. This drops very sharply to several hundred assaults on detectives who are assisting other officers and then increasingly declines to the other shift assignments to the least common assault being against detectives who are acting alone. Figure 7.10: The number of assaults on Los Angeles Police Department officers in disturbance calls by the injury sustained by the shift assignment of the officer, 1960-2022. 7.2.5 Assaults by time The final breakdown in assaults is by the time they occur, divided into 12 two-hour chunks starting at 12:01am. Like some other variables this data is only available starting in 1971. There is no more information than total assaults in this time so we don’t know if the assaults led to injuries, the type of call or shift assignment the officer was on, or the offender’s weapons. 12:01am - 2:00am 2:01am - 4:00am 4:01am - 6:00am 6:01am - 8:00am 8:01am - 10:00am 10:01am - 12:00pm 12:01pm - 2:00pm 2:01pm - 4:00pm 4:01pm - 6:00pm 6:01pm - 8:00pm 8:01pm - 10:00pm 10:01pm - 12:00am We’ll look at these time chunks in Figure 7.11 which shows the total number of assaults by time of day from 1971 to 2018 in Phoenix, Arizona. The most common times for officers to be assaulted looks like a mirror image of when crime is highest: late night and early morning. The 12:01am to 2am chunk is the most common time followed by 10pm to midnight, with assaults increasing at the day grows later and at its lowest point from 6-8am. This strongly suggests that officers are assaulted at crime scenes, such as responding to crimes or making arrests. Figure 7.11: The number of assaults against Phoenix Police Department officers by hourly grouping for all years with data available, 1971-2018. This data is also sometimes called the “Police Employees” dataset.↩︎ The last time I heard, which was several years ago, patrol officers in Philadelphia still had to write up certain reports using typewriters. So tech apparently is still about 1960 level.↩︎ "],["arsonChapter.html", "Chapter 8 Arson 8.1 Agencies reporting 8.2 Important variables 8.3 Types of arsons 8.4 Data errors", " Chapter 8 Arson The arson dataset provides monthly counts at the police agency-level for arsons that occur, and includes a breakdown of arsons by the type of arson (e.g. arson of a person’s home, arson of a vehicle, arson of a community/public building) and the estimated value of the damage caused by the arson. This data includes all arsons reported to the police or otherwise known to the police (e.g. discovered while on patrol) and also has a count of arsons that lead to an arrest (of at least one person who committed the arson) and reports that turned out to not be arsons (such as if an investigation found that the fire was started accidentally). For each type of arson it includes the number of arsons where the structure was uninhabited or otherwise not in use, so you can estimate the percent of arsons of buildings which had the potential to harm people. This measure is for structures where people normally did not inhabit the structure - such as a vacant building where no one lives. A home where no one is home at the time of the arson does not count as an uninhabited building. In cases where the arson led to a death, that death would be recorded as a murder on the Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest dataset - but not indicated anywhere on this dataset. If an individual who responds to the arson dies because of it, such as a police officer or a firefighter, this is not considered a homicide (though the officer death is still included in the Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted data) unless the arsonist intended to cause their deaths. Even though the UCR uses the Hierarchy Rule, where only the most serious offense that occurs is recorded, all arsons are reported - arson is exempt from the Hierarchy Rule. 8.1 Agencies reporting Figure 8.1 shows the annual number of police agencies that reported at least one month that year. With data starting in 1979, there were a little over 12,000 agencies reporting a year until the early 2000s where it recovered from a sharp drop in agencies to steadily increase to about 16,000 a year. While arson data is available through 2019, this graph only shows data through 2018. Figure 8.1: The annual number of police agencies that report at least month of data that year. 8.2 Important variables Similar to the Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest data, which is covered in Chapter 3, this data shows the monthly number of crimes - in this case only arsons - reported or discovered by the police, the number found by police to be unfounded, and the number cleared by the police. In addition, it includes the number of arsons in structures that were uninhabited, and the estimated cost of the damage caused by the arsons. For each variable, the arsons also broken into several categories of arsons, which we’ll talk about in Section 8.3. Like other UCR data, there are also variables that provide information about the agency - ORI codes, population under jurisdiction - the month and year that the data covers, and how many months reported data. 8.2.1 Actual arsons This variable includes the number of arsons either reported to the police or otherwise known to the police in that month and that the police determine to actually be arsons - that is, reports that are not unfounded. This is based only on the police’s determination that an arson occurred, not the decision of other groups like a court or the conviction of someone for the crime. 8.2.2 Unfounded arsons This variable shows the number of arsons reports that the police determined to not actually be arsons. For example, if a house burns down and police think it was arson but later determine that it was an accident, it would be an unfounded arson. 8.2.3 Reported arsons This variable is the sum of actual arsons and unfounded arsons - it is the total number of arsons that were reported or known to the police, even if a later investigation found that it wasn’t actually an arson. Since this is the sum of two already present variables - and is less informative than the two variables are as separate variables - I’m not exactly sure why it’s included. 8.2.4 Cleared arsons This shows the number of arsons where at least one offender is arrested or when an arrest cannot be made for some reason, but the police know who the offender is - the latter option is called “exceptional clearances” or “clearances by exceptional means.” There is no way to tell if a clearance is due to an arrest or due to exceptional means.45. For exceptional clearances, police must have identified the offender, have sufficient evidence to arrest that offender, know where they are (so they can actually be apprehended) and only then be unable to make the arrest. Exceptional clearances include cases where the offender dies before an arrest (by any means, including suicide, accidental, illness, killed by someone including a police officer) or when the police are unable to arrest the person since they are already in custody by another jurisdiction (including out of the country or in custody of another agency) and extradition is denied. Two other potential causes of exceptional clearance is when prosecution of the case cannot go forward because the district attorney refuses to prosecute the case, for reasons other than lack of evidence, or when a victim refuses to assist the prosecution in the case. Please note that this data is at the incident-level which means that having multiple people arrested for an incident still only is a clearance for that single incident. Clearances are also reported in the month they occur, not in the month that the initial crime happened. This can lead to cases where there are more clearances than crimes, incorrectly leading to the conclusion that police solve &gt;100% of crimes. Figure 8.2 shows the number of actual arsons (reports that are founded) and clearances for single-family home arsons in League City, Texas, a city of about 100,000 outside of Houston. In most years there were fewer clearances than arsons, but in four years (1982, 1981, 1992, and 2007) there were more clearances than arsons. This is simply because clearances are reported in the month they occur, regardless of when the arson they are clearing occurred. Figure 8.2: The annual number of single-family home arsons and clearances in League City, Texas. It is rare that there are more clearances than crimes in a given month though this is partially just due to few cases every being cleared. According to the 2019 NIBRS, it takes on average 7 days between the incident and the arrest (median = 0 days) for all crimes, and an average of 11.6 days from incident to arrest for arsons specifically (median = 0 days) for offenders who get arrested. This means that most clearances will be for crimes committed that month, though certainly not all. Therefore, use caution when trying to use this variable to measure crime clearance rates. 8.2.5 Cleared for arsons where all offenders are under age 18 This variable is the same for normal clearances but only for arsons where every offender is under the age of 18. In these cases a clearance by arrest can include citing the juvenile offender with an order to go to court to stand trial, even if the juvenile is not actually taken into police custody. As this variable requires that the police know every offender (to be able to determine that they are all under 18), it is likely highly flawed and not a very useful variable to use. 8.2.6 Uninhabited building arsons This data also includes the number of arsons that occur in uninhabited structures. These structures must be uninhabited in the long-term, not simply having no one inside them when the arson occurs. The FBI defines these are structures that are “uninhabited, abandoned, deserted, or not normally in use” at the time of the arson. For example, a vacation home whose owners aren’t living in at the time would be “not normally in use” so would be an uninhabited building. A business that is closed when the fire started, but is open during the day, is not an uninhabited building. 8.2.7 Estimated damage cost The final variable is the estimated cost of the arson. This is how much the police estimates the value (in dollars) of the damaged or destroyed property is. Since this is the value of property damage, injuries to people (including non-physical injuries such as trauma or mental health costs) are not included. Since this is estimated damage it may be inaccurate to some degree. This variable is the sum of monthly estimated cost so while you can get the average cost by dividing this by the number of actual offenses, this average may be significantly off due to having extremely small or large values in your data. This value may be $0 since arsons include attempted arsons which may cause little or no damage. Please note that this value is not inflation-adjusted so you will have to adjust the value yourself. 8.3 Types of arsons For each of the arson categories above, this dataset has information for ten different types of arson. The type is based on where the arson occurred, not based on how the fire was initiated, how far or fast it spread, or any other information about the arson - nothing is actually known about the arson outcome other than if the arson was cleared and the estimated damage. There are seven arsons types for buildings, two for vehicles, and one as an “other” category that includes arsons of outdoor areas like parks or forests (though this group does not have any subcategories so all you know is the arson is neither of a building or a vehicle). For both the buildings and the vehicle arson types there is also a “total buildings” and “total vehicles” category that is just the sum of each subcategory; there is also a “grant total” variable that sums all building, vehicle, and other arsons. Building arsons Single occupancy home Other residential Storage Industrial/manufacturing building Other commercial building Community or public building All other structures Vehicles Motor vehicles Other vehicles All other arsons Some arsons can burn down multiple types or structures or cars - fire, after all, tends to spread. This data defines the arson based on where the fire originated. So an arson that starts in someone’s house and also burns down their car in the garage would be a single-family home arson, not a vehicle arson. This is true even if the damage is more severe for a type other than where the fire started. So if someone threw a Molotov cocktail at a car parked outside a house and it lightly damaged the car but spread to homes nearby and destroyed those homes, it is still a vehicle arson (though the damage recorded would include the homes burned.) 8.4 Data errors Like the other UCR data, there are some cases where there are obvious data entry errors leading to impossible numbers of reported arsons or the price of an arson. As an example, Figure 8.3 shows the annual number of single-family home arsons in Byron City, Illinois, which has a population of slightly over 3,600 people. Every year with data available there are zero arsons reported until 2003 when 469 arsons are reported. Since it is exceedingly unlikely that suddenly an eighth of the city suddenly burned down, and the city never again had a residence arson, this is almost certainly a data entry error. As arsons are relatively rare, having errors - and especially ones like this - can drastically change the results of your analysis so it is important to check your data carefully for more errors. Figure 8.3: Annual single-family home arsons in Byron City, Illinois. The sudden spike to over 400 arsons in a single year is an example of data errors in this dataset. There are also cases where it is less clear when a value is a data error or is simply due to an outlier - but real - value. For example, Figure 8.4 shows the annual average cost of a single-family home fire in Los Angeles, California. In most years the damage is low - since an arson can damage only part of the house, these low values likely mean that on average only part of the house was damaged, not the entire house. In 2009, however, the average damage is about $540,000 per arson. Is this a data entry error that simply inputs a damage value that is too high? It certainly appears to be a data error since it’s a sudden huge jump in damage value. However, it could also be that some extraordinarily expensive homes were destroyed that year. In 2009 Los Angeles only reported 63 single-family home arsons so having one, or a few, super mansions - which LA has plenty of - destroyed could mean that this huge value is real. Figure 8.4: The annual average cost per single-family home arson in Los Angeles, California. NIBRS data does tell more information about the type of arrest, but UCR data does not↩︎ "],["hate_crimes.html", "Chapter 9 Hate Crime Data 9.1 Agencies reporting 9.2 Important variables", " Chapter 9 Hate Crime Data This dataset covers crimes that are reported to the police and judged by the police to be motivated by hate. More specifically, they are, first, crimes which were, second, motivated - at least in part - by bias towards a certain person or group of people because of characteristics about them such as race, sexual orientation, or religion. The first part is key, they must be crimes - and really must be the selection of crimes that the FBI collects for this dataset. Biased actions that don’t meet the standard of a crime, or are of a crime not included in this data, are not considered hate crimes. For example, if someone yells at a Black person and uses racial slurs against them, it is clearly a racist action. For it to be included in this data, however, it would have to extend to a threat since “intimidation” is a crime included in this data but lesser actions such as simply insulting someone is not included. For the second part, the bias motivation, it must be against a group that the FBI includes in this data. For example, when this data collection began crimes against transgender people were not counted so if a transgender person was assaulted or killed because they were transgender, this is not a hate crime recorded in the data (though it would have counted in the “Anti-Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Or Transgender, Mixed Group (LGBT)” bias motivation which was always reported).46 So this data is really a narrower measure of hate crimes than it might seem. In practice it is (some) crimes motivated by (some) kinds of hate that are reported to the police. It is also the most under-reported UCR dataset with most agencies not reporting any hate crimes to the FBI. This leads to huge gaps in the data with some states having zero agencies report crime, agencies reporting some bias motivations but not others, agencies reporting some years but not others. While these problems exist for all of the UCR datasets, it is most severe in this data. This problem is exacerbated by hate crimes being rare even in agencies that report them - with such rare events, even minor changes in which agencies report or which types of offenses they include can have large effects. My main takeaway for this data is that it is inappropriate to use for most hate crime research. At most it can be used to look at within-city within-bias-motivation trends, while keeping in mind that even this narrow subset of data is limited by under-reporting by victims and potential changes in police practices of reporting such as how many months of data they report per year. 9.1 Agencies reporting We’ll start by looking at how many agencies report hate crime each year. This is a bit tricky since there can be multiple ways to examine how agencies report, and since agencies can truly have no hate crimes in a year so it’s hard to differentiate the true zeroes from the non-reporters. Figure 9.1 shows the number of agencies that report at least one hate crime incident in that year. From the start in 1991 there were about 750 agencies reporting and that grew steadily to about 2,000 agencies in year 2000. From there it increased a bit over the next decade before declining to below 1,750 in the early 2010s and rising again to around 2,000 agencies at the end of our data. Figure 9.1: The annual number of police agencies that report at least one hate crime incident in that year. The 2,000 or so agencies that report each year are not the same every year. Figure 9.2 shows the cumulative number of agencies that have reported at least one hate crime between 1991 and 2020 There is a steady growth in the cumulative number of agencies, with about 350 new agencies each year. This means that each year some new agencies report hate crimes while some agencies that reported a hate crime in the previous year don’t report any hate crimes in the current year. Figure 9.2: The cumulative number of agencies that have reported one or more hate crimes between 1991 to 2020 Figure 9.3 puts this into hard numbers by showing the percent of agencies who reported a hate crime in a certain year who also reported a hate crime in the previous year. For most years between 50% and 60% of agencies which reported a hate crime in the year shown on the x-axis also reported a hate crime in the previous year, indicating somewhat high consistency in which agencies have hate crimes. Figure 9.3: The percent of agencies that report a hate crime in a given year that also reported a hate crime in the previous year, 1992-2020 Another way to understand reporting is to look at the number of reported hate crimes by state and see which states report and which don’t. Figure 9.4 does this for 2020 data by showing the number of reported hate crime incidents by state. While every state other than Wyoming reporting at least one hate crime in 2020, there are large differences between states because even in states that have reporting agencies, not all agencies in that state report. For example, Alabama reported only two hate crimes in 2020, the least of any state other than Wyoming. Figure 9.4: Total reported hate crimes by state, 2020 Since the number of state-wide hate crimes is partially influenced by population, we’ll also look at it as the percent of agencies in the state that report at least one hate crime. Again this is limited by population as agencies in each state cover different populations - and most agencies are small so a few large agencies can account for a large share of crimes, including hate crimes. Still, this is a useful exercise as we can easily see where very few agencies report. Figure 9.5 shows the percent of agencies for each state that reported at least one hate crime in 2020 In Connecticut, the state with the highest percent of agencies reporting, 28% of agencies reported at least one hate crime. In 34 states, fewer than 10% of agencies reported a hate crime, and in 19 states fewer than 5% of agencies did so. One interesting finding from this graph is the more liberal states - Connecticut, New Jersey, Vermont, California, Washington - have the highest share of agencies reporting a hate crime, indicating that the culture of the state may influence either the propensity of hate crimes, whether victims report, or whether agencies report hate crimes. Figure 9.5: The percent of agencies in each state that reported at least one hate crime in 2020 9.2 Important variables This data has the standard set of variables describing the agency that is reporting. This includes the agency ORI - which is the unique ID for that agency - the agency name, their state, and the population under their jurisdiction. They also have a variable with the exact date that the hate crime occurred on - though not the date it was reported on. Figure 9.6 shows the percent of hates crimes between 1991 and 2020 that occurred on each day of the week. Interestingly, the most common days for a hate crime to occur is on Friday and Saturday, which is also when non-hate crimes most frequently occur. This suggests that hate crimes do follow the same trends - at least partially - as other crimes. Figure 9.6: The day of the week that hate crimes occurred on, 1991-2022 Each hate crime incident can cover up to 10 different crimes occurring - e.g. a person who burglarizes a synagogue and spray paints a swastika on the wall would have both vandalism and burglary reported in this data. With each crime, this data has the bias motivation for that crime, the location of the crime (in broad categories, not the actual location in the city like a street address would have), and the number of victims for that offense. In practice, in most hate crimes with multiple offenses recorded, the bias motivation, location, and victim count is the same for each offense. Figure 9.7 shows the number of crimes per incident for each hate crime reported between 1991 and 2020 In 96.6% of cases, there is only one offense in that incident.47 This drops sharply to 3.2% of incidents having two offenses, 0.21% having three offenses, 0.016% having four offenses, and 0.002% having five offenses. Even though this data does allow up to 10 offenses per hate crime incident, there has never been a recorded case with more than five offenses. Figure 9.7: The number of offenses per hate crime incident. 9.2.1 The bias motivation (who the hate is against) The most important variable in this data is the “bias motivation” which is the FBI’s term for the cause of the hate. A hate crime targeted against Black people would be an “anti-Black” bias motivation. For the police to classify an incident as a hate crime, and to assign a particular bias motivation, the police must have some evidence that the crime was motivated by hate. The victim saying that the crime is a hate crime alone is not sufficient - though if large portions of the victim’s community believe that the crime is a hate crime, this is a factor in the police’s assessment. The evidence required is not major, it includes things as explicit as racial slurs said during an incident and less obvious factors like the victim is celebrating their community (e.g. attending a holiday event) or the crime occurring on an important holiday for that community (e.g. Martin Luther King Day, religious holidays). The FBI also encourages police to consider the totality of the evidence even if none alone strongly suggests that the crime was a hate crime in making their determination about whether the incident was a hate crime or not. This also means that many (likely most) hate crimes will not be recorded as hate crimes since there is no evidence that the crime is motivated by hate. For example, if a man committed a crime against Asian people for crimes because they are Asian, that would in reality be a hate crime. However, if the offender does not say anything anti-Asian to the victim, which is the mostly likely thing to indicate that this is a hate crime, the crime would not likely be recorded as a hate crime. For example, at the time of this writing (Spring, 2021), there are numerous media reports discussing an increase in anti-Asian hate crimes as a result of racism relating to the pandemic.48 This data would likely undercount both anti-Asian behavior and anti-Asian hate crimes. First, if someone walked to an Asian person and called them an anti-Asian slur, that is clearly a hateful act and would be classified as a hate crime under some organization’s collections methods. However, as hateful as this incident is, this alone would not be classified as a hate crime in this dataset as a slur is not a crime. If accompanied by other criminal behavior, or if it continues to the point where it can be considered intimidation, it would then be classified as a hate crime. Second, crimes against Asian victims that are in fact hate crimes, but have no evidence that they are hate crimes would not be classified as hate crimes in this data. Bias motivation is based on the offender’s perceptions of the victim so even if they are incorrect in who their victim is, if they intended to target someone for their perceived group membership, that is still a hate crime. For example, if a person assaults a man because they think he is gay, that is a hate crime because the assault was motivated by hate towards gay people. Whether the victim is actually gay or not is not relevant - the offender perceived him to be gay so it is an anti-gay hate crime. To make this even more complicated, the offender must have committed the crime because they are motivated, at least to some degree, by their bias against the victim. Being biased against the victim but targeting them for some other reason means that the crime is not a hate crime. The biases that the FBI includes in this data has grown over time, with new bias motivations being added in 1997, 2012, 2013, and 2015. Table 9.1 shows each bias motivation in this data, the year it was first reported, how many hate crimes there were for this bias motivation from 1991-2022 and what percent of hate crimes that bias motivation makes up. For ease of seeing how bias motivations changed over time, the table is sorted by year and by frequency of incident within that year. If you’re viewing this on a computer or phone, you can sort the table yourself. The year is the first year with that bias motivation - as hate crimes for certain groups are very rare, the bias motivation could have technically been available in previous years. The last column in this table shows the percent of hate crimes from 1991-2022, though this is a very rough measure since some groups are so small that even accounting for a small percent of total hate crimes can mean that are massively disproportionately targeted. Table 9.1: The bias motivation for hate crime incidents. In incidents with multiple bias motivation, this shows only the first bias motivation recorded.

In 2013, anti-Transgender was added and this is the most common of the bias motivations added since data began in 1991 with 513 hate crimes between 2013-2020 - 0.26% of all hate crimes from 1991-2022 That year also added anti-male and Anti-Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, which is the most recent racial group added. In 2012, anti-gender non-conforming and anti-female were included, while in 1997 both anti-mental and anti-physical disability were added. In part due to having fewer years of data available, these newer bias motivations make up a small percent of total hate crimes, accounting for ~1.4%. The original hate crimes - that is, those in the data in 1991 when this dataset was released - are far more common. The most common bias motivation is anti-Black at 34% of hate crimes, anti-Jewish at 13%, anti-White at 12%, anti-male homosexual (gay) at 10%, anti-Hispanic at 6%, and anti-ethnicity other than Hispanic (this group means a crime against an ethnic group that isn’t Hispanic, though it is occasionally reported as anti-non-Hispanic which is incorrect.) at 5%. All other bias motivations are less than 5% of hate crimes and consist of a variety of ethnic, racial, religious, or sexual orientation. Some hate crimes can potentially fall in multiple categories. For example, there is a bias motivation of “anti-male homosexual (gay)” and of “anti-lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender, mixed group (LGBT)” so there is some overlap between them. 9.2.2 The crime that occurred The “crime” part of hate crimes is which criminal offense occurred during the incident. A hateful act where the action is not one of the crimes that the FBI records would not be considered a hate crime. This is likely most common when considering something like a person calling someone by a hateful slur (e.g. “You’re a [slur]”, “go back to your own country”) but where the action is not technically a crime. Another layer of difficulty in using this data is that not all crimes that the FBI includes were initially included when data become available in 1991. Every several years the FBI adds new crimes to be included in this data. Table 9.2 shows each crime in the data, the first year that this crime was reported, the total number of these crimes reported between 1991 and 2020, and the percent of all incidents this crime makes up.49 This table is sorted with the most recent years first, and within year by how common the crime was. Nearly all hate crimes are vandalism/destruction of property (31%), intimidation (30%), and simple assault (20%) or aggravated assault (11%) with no remaining crime making up more than 2% of total hate crimes.

One tricky thing is that the crimes included are different depending on if the agency reported through NIBRS or to the dataset directly, and are not NIBRS reporting agencies. The above table shows all crimes included, but agencies who report directly can only submit a subset of crimes. For these agencies the only possible crimes are the ones that are included Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest dataset, that is detailed in Chapter 3, as well as vandalism/destruction of property and human trafficking. 9.2.3 The location of the crime This data is interesting because it includes the location - in categories for types of places, not actual location in the city - of the incident. This is important since the type of location can be a factor in whether the incident is classified as a hate crime. For example, spray paint on a synagogue or a mosque is much more likely to be a hate crime than spray paint on a wall of an abandoned building. Table 9.3 shows the locations of hate crimes sorted by the year that location was first included in the data and then by frequency of hate crimes. Each hate crime incident can have multiple locations since each offense can have its own incident, but in most cases (96.6%) a hate crime only has a single location. As with the crime and the bias motivation, the available locations have increased as time went on, though these newer locations are relatively uncommon. One important change in location is that starting in 2010 the location of school/college was split to have one location be for elementary and high schools and another location be for colleges and universities. The majority of hate crimes occur in the victim’s home (30%), on a road or alley (19%), in an unknown location (13.6%), and in a parking lot or parking garage. All other locations occur in fewer than 5% of hate crimes. Table 9.3: The location of hate crime incidents. In incidents with multiple locations, this shows only the first location recorded.

Unfortunately, important information like the age of the offenders, their criminal history, their relationship to the victim, their gender, or whether they are arrested are completely unavailable in this dataset. When the police do not have any information about the number of offenders (which is common in cases of property crimes such as vandalism but rare in violent crimes), this data considers that to have zero offenders. The zero is just a placeholder that means that the police have no idea how many offenders there are, not that they think there were actually no offenders. Figure 9.8 shows the percent of hate crimes from 1991-2022 that have each number of offenders recorded. In the actual data it says the actual number of offenders, with the largest group in the current data going to 99 offenders - in this graph I group 10 or more offenders together for simplicity. I also relabel zero offenders as “Unknown” offenders since that’s more accurate. The most common number of offenders per hate crime is one offender, at about 46% of hate crimes from 1991-2022 having only one offender. This drops sharply to 9% of hate crimes having 2 offenders and continues to drop as the number of offenders increase. However, about a third (36.8%) of hate crimes have an unknown number of offenders. Figure 9.8: The race of offenders, as a group, for hate crime incidents, 1991-2022. The data also includes the race of the offenders as a group, though not the ethnicity (Hispanic or non-Hispanic) of the offenders. In cases where there are multiple races among offenders, that will be classified as a “multi-racial group”. As shown in Figure 9.8 The most common racial group is “unknown” since the police do not know the race of the offenders. Then are White offenders at nearly 40% of hate crimes followed by Black offenders at nearly 13% of hate crimes. The remaining racial groups are rare with about 2% of hate crimes being committed by a multi-racial group of offenders and 0.72% of hate crimes committed by Asian or Pacific Islander offenders and 0.54% committed by American Indian or Native Alaskan offenders. Figure 9.9: The race of offenders, as a group, for hate crime incidents, 1991-2022. The first year where transgender as a group was a considered a bias motivation was in 2013.↩︎ In 0.0005% of hate crimes there is no recorded offense. This is not shown in the graph.↩︎ This dataset for 2020 won’t be released until Fall 2021 so this data is not useful for measuring urgent policies about current events.↩︎ This tables uses only the first offense in an incident so counts are slightly lower than if all crimes in every incident is used.↩︎ "],["county-level-ucr-data.html", "Chapter 10 County-Level UCR Data 10.1 Current usage 10.2 How much data is missing 10.3 Current imputation practices 10.4 Final thoughts", " Chapter 10 County-Level UCR Data UCR data is only available at the agency-level.50 This has caused a lot of problems for researchers because many variables from other datasets (e.g. CDC data, economic data) is primarily available at the county-level. Their solution to this problem is to aggregate the data to the county-level by summing all the agencies in a particular county.51 More specifically, nearly all researchers who use this county-level UCR data use the National Archive for Criminal Justice Data (NACJD)’s datasets which have done the aggregation themselves (full disclosure, I used to have my own version of this data available on openICPSR and followed NACJD’s method. My reasoning was that people were using it anyways and I wanted to make sure that they knew the problem of the data, so I included the issues with this data in the documentation when downloading it. However, I decided that the data was more flawed than I originally thought so I took down the data.).52 These are not official FBI datasets but “UCR staff were consulted in developing the new adjustment procedures”.53 The “new” procedures is because NACJD changed their missing data imputation procedure starting with 1994 UCR data, and for this chapter I’ll only focus on this “new” procedure. There are two new problems with county-level UCR data: 1) agencies in multiple counties, 2) and agencies with missing data. I say main new problems as other problems with the data such as definition changes for crimes and underreporting of crimes are inherent in the agency-level data and thus transferred to the county-level data. The first issue is in distributing crimes across counties when an agency is in multiple counties. If, for example, New York City had 100 murders in a given year, how do you create county-level data from this? UCR data only tells you how many crimes happened in a particular agency, not where in the jurisdiction it happened. So we have no idea how many of these 100 murders happened in Kings County, how many happened in Bronx County, and so on. UCR data does, however, tell you how many counties the agency is in and the population of each. They only do this for up to three counties so in cases like New York City you don’t actually have every county the agency is part of.54 NACJD’s method is to distribute crimes according to the population of the agency in each county. In the New York City example, Kings County is home to about 31% of the people in NYC while Bronx County is home to about 17%. So Kings County would get 31 murders while Bronx County gets 17 murders. The problem with this is the crime is not evenly distributed by population. Indeed, crime is generally extremely concentrated in a small number of areas in a city. Even if 100% of the murders in NYC actually happened in Bronx County, only 17% would get assigned there. So for agencies in multiple counties - which is very common among the largest agencies in the country, and seems more common in some regions than others - the crimes assigned may be massively incorrect. The second problem is that not all agencies report data, and even those that do may report only partially (e.g. report fewer than 12 months of the year). So by necessity the missing data has to be filled in somehow. While all methods FOR imputing missing data are wrong - as they will be different than the real data, though sometimes not by much - the ways done to impute the missing data in this dataset are particularly incorrect. We’ll go into more detail about why they’re incorrect in this chapter. In this chapter, I’ll then talk about the data as it is with a focus on why the data is flawed and shouldn’t be used. To be clear, all data has measurement errors and much of this book is dedicated to talking about the errors in the other UCR datasets. The problems in the county-level data, however, are egregious enough to merit special warning. This is by no means the first warning about this data. Most famously is Maltz and Targonski’s (2002) paper in the Journal of Quantitative Criminology about the issues with this data. They concluded that “Until improved methods of imputing county-level crime data are developed, tested, and implemented, they should not be used, especially in policy studies” which is a conclusion I also hold. These warnings, as well as those from others have been largely (it appears) ignored.55 10.1 Current usage Even with the well-known flaws of this data, it remains a popular dataset. A search on Google Scholar for “county-level UCR” returns 3,780 results as of this writing in summer 2021. About half of these results are from 2015 or later. In addition to use by researchers, the county-level UCR data is used by organizations such as the FBI in their annual Crimes in the United States report (which is essentially the report that informs the media and the public about crime, even though it’s actually only a subset of actual UCR data) and Social Explorer, a website that makes it extremely convenient to examine US Census data. Based on my reading of UCR papers there are also some differences in data usage by field.56 This data is most widely used (as a share of papers in the field) by economics researchers and fields other than criminology such as the relatively rare psychologist or political scientist studying crime.57 Criminologists, however, tend to focus more on agency-level data rather than county-level data, though many criminologists still do use county-level UCR data.58 10.2 How much data is missing A major problem with county-level UCR data is that some data is missing, and is then imputed (poorly). So to understand how much of an issue missing data is in the county-level UCR data, we’ll now look at missingness in the Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrests dataset which is the “crime data” of the UCR. County-level data also aggregates arrests from the Arrests by Age, Sex, and Race dataset, which has lower reporting (and thus more missingness) than the Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest data. But for simplicity we’ll only look at the crime dataset. We’ll do so in a number of different ways to try to really understand how much data is missing and how it changed over time. For each of the below graphs and tables we use the Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest data for 1960-2022 and exclude any agency that are “special jurisdictions”. Special jurisdiction agencies are, as it seems, special agencies that tend to have an extremely specific jurisdiction and goals. These include agencies such as port authorities, alcohol beverage control, university police, and airport police. These agencies tend to cover a tiny geographic area and have both very low crime and very low reporting rates.59 So to prevent missingness being overcounted due to these weird agencies I’m excluding them from the below examples. I’m also excluding federal agencies (though UCR only has 7 reporting federal agencies) as these operate much the same as special jurisdiction agencies. We’ll first look at how many months are reported in the example year of 2018, though we’ll see below that 2018 is pretty similar to other years. Table 10.1 shows the number of months reported using two definitions. The first is how the FBI, and NACJD when imputing data, classifies number of months reported and this is actually just the last month reported. So if an agency reports only in July they are classified as reporting 7 months; if they report only in December they are classified as reporting 12 months. Whether they actually report previous months doesn’t matter based on this definition. The second definition is my own - and available in the data I’ve released on openICPSR - and is based on how many months the data says the agency reported. That is, for each month the UCR data actually says if they received a report or not. So this is a superior way of measuring though not full-proof as some months say they have a report but don’t and some say they don’t have a report but do have crime recorded. Also, in 2018 the FBI changed how they classify this variable so now every month is reported for every agency, making the measurement useless for 2018 and more recent data. The table shows what percent of agencies that reported data had data for each possible number of months: 0 through 12 months. Column 2 shows the percent for the 1st method while column 3 shows the percent for my method. And the final column shows the percent change from moving from the 1st to 2nd measure. Ultimately the measures are quite similar though systematically overcount reporting using the 1st method. Both show that about 23% of agencies reported zero months. The 1st method has nearly 73% of agencies reporting 12 months while the 2nd method has 69%, a difference of about 5% which is potentially a sizable difference depending on exactly which agencies are missing. The remaining nearly 4% of agencies all have far more people in the 2nd method than in the first, which is because in the 1st method those agencies are recorded as having 12 months since they reported in December but not actually all 12 months of the year. There are huge percent increases in moving from the 1st to 2nd method for 1-11 months reported though this is due to having very few agencies report this many months. Most months have only about 50 agencies in the 1st method and about 70 in the 2nd, so the actual difference is not that large. Table 10.1: The number of months reported to the 2017 Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest data using two definitions of months reported. The ‘Last Month’ definition is the preferred measure of months reported by both the FBI and researchers, though this overcounts months. Months Reported Last Month Definition Months Not Missing Definition Percent Difference 0 4,481 (23.01%) 4,514 (23.18%) +0.74 1 93 (0.48%) 112 (0.58%) +20.43 2 36 (0.18%) 70 (0.36%) +94.44 3 40 (0.21%) 156 (0.8%) +290.00 4 44 (0.23%) 66 (0.34%) +50.00 5 42 (0.22%) 78 (0.4%) +85.71 6 48 (0.25%) 78 (0.4%) +62.50 7 55 (0.28%) 81 (0.42%) +47.27 8 56 (0.29%) 87 (0.45%) +55.36 9 56 (0.29%) 102 (0.52%) +82.14 10 158 (0.81%) 242 (1.24%) +53.16 11 199 (1.02%) 419 (2.15%) +110.55 12 14,162 (72.74%) 13,465 (69.16%) -4.92 We can look at how these trends change over time in Figure 10.1 that shows the annual number of agencies that reported at least one month of data in that year. About 5,500 agencies reported at least on month throughout the 1960s and then grew rapidly over the next decade until about 12,500 agencies reported in the end of the 1970s. This declined over the next two decades before again increasing in the mid-late 1990s where it steadily increased to about 14,000 agencies in 2010 and has stagnated since then, with a small dip in 2018. Out of the approximately 18,000 police agencies in the United States, this is relatively low reporting even as far as recent decades. Figure 10.1: The annual number of agencies that reported at least one month of data in that year. We saw in Table 10.1 that when agencies do report they tend to report all 12 months of the year. Figure 10.2 examines whether this is true by showing the number of agencies in each year that reported in December, which the way that county-level UCR data assumes that all 12 months are reported. The trends are nearly identical to Figure 10.1 but with several hundred fewer agencies reporting in December each year than reporting at least one month. This shows that the trend of when agencies do report they tend to report all 12 months (or at least report in December) is consistent over time. Figure 10.2: The annual number of agencies that reported data in December of that year (which by the FBI’s definition would mean they reported 12 months of the year. Another way to look at this is to examine, as Figure 10.3 does, the percent of agencies that report in December of agencies that report at least one month. On average about 92% of agencies that do report any month also report in December, and this number has steadily grown over time, though declined in 2018 to only 90%. Figure 10.3: The annual percent of agencies that reported in December of that year of those that reported at least one month of data. Since the number of agencies reporting changes every year - generally increasing over time - we can look at the percent of agencies that reported in December out of all agencies that reported data (and this includes reporting zero months of data) to UCR. Figure 10.4 shows this trend over time and about 75% of agencies that submit to UCR each year report in December. Reporting rates undulate over this time period - the low is 62% in 1997 and the high is 83% in 1979 - but tend to return to ~75% reporting before trending in the opposite direction again. Figure 10.4: The annual percent of agencies that reported in December of that year including those that did not report any data that year. Not all agencies report data to UCR, even to say that they’re not reporting any months of data. In 1960, for example, only 8,452 agencies reported data to UCR and 1,406 of these reported zero months of data. To get accurate data on county crime you’ll want data from all agencies, not just ones that reported (or told the FBI they weren’t reporting) data. Figure 10.5 shows the annual percent of agencies that reported in December of each year out of the 19,036 agencies that ever reported to UCR. This 19,036 is higher than the ~18,000 agencies often discussed (including in this book) by academics as the approximate number of agencies. I believe that the number here is higher because it includes agencies that may have closed or been swallowed by a larger or nearby agency. The trends in Figure 10.5 are very similar to those in Figure 10.1. In the first decade of data only about 25% of agencies reported December data and this rose rapidly to over 60% of agencies in the late 1970s. From here it rather steadily declined until it bottomed out at nearly 50% in 1993 and began rising again. Reporting rates peaked at the mid-60% starting in 2010 and remained stagnant until declining to 62% in 2018. The zero reporting agencies are largely in smaller agencies - with the average sized agency in 2018 having a population of 1,682 and the largest having a population of 463,545 - and, in 2018, amounts to agencies covering about 13 million people, or about 4% of the United States population. Figure 10.5: The annual percent of agencies that reported in December of that year out of all agencies that ever reported to the Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest dataset (N=19,036). 10.3 Current imputation practices There are three paths that the county-level UCR data takes when dealing with the agency-level data before aggregating it to the county-level. The path each agency is on is dependent on how many months of data they report. Figure 10.6 shows each of these three paths. We’ll look in detail at these paths in the below sections, but for now we’ll briefly summarize each path. First, if an agency reports only two or fewer months, the entire agency’s data (that is, any month that they do report) is deleted and their annual data is replaced with the average of agencies that are: 1) in the same state, 2) in the same population group (i.e. very roughly the same size), 3) and that reported all 12 months of the year (i.e. reported in December but potentially not any other month). When an agency reports 3-11 months, those months of data are multiplied by 12/numbers-of-months-reported so it just upweights the available data to account for the missing months, assuming that missing months are like the present months. Finally, for agencies that reported all 12 months there’s nothing missing so it just uses the data as it is. Figure 10.6: The imputation procedure for missing data based on the number of months missing. 10.3.1 1-9 months missing When there are 1-9 months reported the missing months are imputed by multiplying the reported months of data by 12/numbers-of-months-reported, essentially just scaling up the reported months. For example, if 6 months are reported then it multiplies each crime values by 12/6=2, doubling each reported crime value. This method makes the assumption that missing values are similar to present ones, at on average. Given that there are seasonal differences in crime - which tends to increase in the summer and decrease in the winter - how accurate this replacement is depends on how consistent crime is over the year and which months are missing. Miss the summer months and you’ll undercount crime. Miss the winter months and you’ll overcount crime. Miss random months and you’ll be wrong randomly (and maybe it’ll balance out but maybe it won’t). We’ll look at a number of examples and simulations about how accurate this method is. For each example we’ll use agencies that reported in 2018 so we have a real comparison when using their method of replacing “missing” months. Starting with Table 10.2, we will see the change in the actual annual count of murders in Philadelphia when replacing data from each month. Each row shows what happens when you assume that month - and only that month - is missing and interpolate using the current 12/numbers-of-months-reported method. Column 1 shows the month that we are “replacing” while column 2 shows the actual number of murders in that month and the percent of annual murders in parentheses. Column 3 shows the actual annual murders which is 351 in 2018; column 4 shows the annual murder count when imputing the “missing” month” and column 5 shows the percent change between columns 3 and 4. If each month had the same number of crimes we’d expect each month to account for 8.33% of the year’s total. That’s not what we’re seeing in Philadelphia for murders as the percentages range from 5.13% in both January and April to 12.25% in December. This means that replacing these months will not give us an accurate count of crimes as crime is not distributed evenly across months. Indeed, as seen in column 5, on average, the annual sum of murders when imputing a single month is 1.85% off from the real value. When imputing the worst (as far as its effect on results) months you can report murder as either 4.27% lower than it is or 3.5% higher than it is. Table 10.2: The imputed number of murders in Philadelphia in 2018 when missing a single month. This shows how different the imputed value is to the real value for each month missing. Month Murders That Month Actual Annual Murders Imputed Annual Murders Percent Change January 18 (5.13%) 351 363 +3.42 February 26 (7.41%) 351 355 +1.14 March 27 (7.69%) 351 353 +0.57 April 18 (5.13%) 351 363 +3.42 May 33 (9.40%) 351 347 -1.14 June 26 (7.41%) 351 355 +1.14 July 27 (7.69%) 351 353 +0.57 August 41 (11.68%) 351 338 -3.70 September 32 (9.12%) 351 348 -0.85 October 27 (7.69%) 351 353 +0.57 November 33 (9.40%) 351 347 -1.14 December 43 (12.25%) 351 336 -4.27 Part of the reason for the percent difference for murders when replacing a month found above is that there was high variation in the number of murders per month with some months having more than double the number as other months. We’ll look at what happens when crimes are far more evenly distributed across months in Table 10.3. This table replicates Table 10.2 but uses thefts in Philadelphia in 2018 instead of murders. Here the monthly share of thefts ranged only from 6.85% to 9.16% so month-to-month variation is not very large. Now the percent change never increases above an absolute value of 1.62 and changes by an average of 0.77%. In cases like this, the imputation method is less of a problem. Table 10.3: The imputed number of thefts in Philadelphia in 2018 when missing a single month. This shows how different the imputed value is to the real value for each month missing. Month Thefts That Month Actual Annual Thefts Imputed Annual Thefts Percent Change January 2,720 (7.36%) 36,968 37,361 +1.06 February 2,532 (6.85%) 36,968 37,567 +1.62 March 2,598 (7.03%) 36,968 37,495 +1.43 April 3,200 (8.66%) 36,968 36,838 -0.35 May 3,215 (8.70%) 36,968 36,821 -0.40 June 3,226 (8.73%) 36,968 36,809 -0.43 July 3,312 (8.96%) 36,968 36,716 -0.68 August 3,454 (9.34%) 36,968 36,561 -1.10 September 3,287 (8.89%) 36,968 36,743 -0.61 October 3,386 (9.16%) 36,968 36,635 -0.90 November 2,906 (7.86%) 36,968 37,159 +0.52 December 3,132 (8.47%) 36,968 36,912 -0.15 Given that the imputation method is largely dependent on consistency across months, what happens when crime is very rare? Table 10.4 shows what happens when replacing a single month for motor vehicle thefts in Danville, California, a small town which had 22 of these thefts in 2018. While possible to still have an even distribution of crimes over months, this is less likely when it comes to rare events. Here, having so few motor vehicle thefts means that small changes in monthly crimes can have an outsize effect. The average absolute value percent change now is 7.3% and this ranges from a -15.68% difference to a +9.1% difference from the real annual count. This means that having even a single month missing can vastly overcount or undercount the real values. Table 10.4: The imputed number of motor vehicle thefts in Danville, California, in 2018 when missing a single month. This shows how different the imputed value is to the real value for each month missing. Month Vehicle Thefts That Month Actual Annual Vehicle Thefts Imputed Annual Vehicle Thefts Percent Change January 3 (13.64%) 22 21 -4.55 February 0 (0.00%) 22 24 +9.09 March 1 (4.55%) 22 23 +4.55 April 2 (9.09%) 22 22 +0.00 May 3 (13.64%) 22 21 -4.55 June 1 (4.55%) 22 23 +4.55 July 1 (4.55%) 22 23 +4.55 August 0 (0.00%) 22 24 +9.09 September 5 (22.73%) 22 19 -13.64 October 5 (22.73%) 22 19 -13.64 November 1 (4.55%) 22 23 +4.55 December 0 (0.00%) 22 24 +9.09 In the above three tables we looked at what happens if a single month is missing. Below we’ll look at the results of simulating when between 1 and 9 months are missing for an agency. Table 10.5 looks at murder in Philadelphia again but now randomizes removing between 1 and 9 months of the year and interpolating the annual murder count using the current method. For each number of months removed I run 10,000 simulations.60 Given that I am literally randomly choosing which months to say are missing, I am assuming that missing data is missing completely at random. This is a very bold assumption and one that is the best-case scenario since it means that missing data is not related to crimes, police funding/staffing, or anything else relevant. So you should read the below tables as the most optimistic (and thus likely wrong) outcomes. For each number of months reported the table shows the actual annual murder (which never changes) and the imputed mean, median, modal, minimum, and maximum annual murder count. As a function of the randomization, the imputed mean is always nearly identical to the real value. The most important columns, I believe, are the minimum and maximum imputed value since these show the worst-case scenario - that is, what happens when the month(s) least like the average month is replaced. Since as researchers we should try to minimize the harm caused from our work if it is wrong, I think it is safest to assume that if data is missing it is missing in the worst possible way. While this is a conservative approach, doing so otherwise leads to the greatest risk of using incorrect data, and incorrect results - and criminology is a field important enough to necessitate this caution. As might be expected, as the number of months missing increases the quality of the imputation decreases. The minimum is further and further below the actual value while the maximum is further and further above the actual value. Table 10.5: A simulation showing how the imputed values of murders in Philadelphia in 2018 changes as the number of months to impute changes. For each number of months missing (and thus, imputed) 10,000 simulations are run for removing and imputing those months of data. # of Months Missing Actual Murder Mean Imputed Murder Median Imputed Murder Modal Imputed Murder Min Imputed Murder Max Imputed Murder 1 351 351.07 353.45 353.45 336.00 363.27 2 351 350.93 350.40 350.40 320.40 378.00 3 351 351.07 353.33 353.33 312.00 385.33 4 351 351.00 349.50 370.50 301.50 394.50 5 351 351.22 351.43 353.14 289.71 404.57 6 351 350.96 352.00 376.00 284.00 418.00 7 351 351.19 350.40 348.00 276.00 436.80 8 351 351.03 354.00 312.00 264.00 450.00 9 351 351.29 348.00 344.00 248.00 468.00 This problem is even more pronounced when looking at agencies with fewer crimes and less evenly distributed crimes. Table 10.6 repeats the above table but now looks at motor vehicle thefts in Danville, California. By the time 5 months are missing, the minimum value is nearly half of the actual value while the maximum value is a little under 50% larger than the actual value. By 9 months missing, possible imputed values range from 0% of the actual value to over twice as large as the actual value. Table 10.6: A simulation showing how the imputed values of motor vehicle thefts in Danville, California, in 2018 changes as the number of months to impute changes. For each number of months missing (and thus, imputed) 10,000 simulations are run for removing and imputing those months of data. # of Months Missing Actual Vehicle Theft Mean Imputed Vehicle Theft Median Imputed Vehicle Theft Modal Imputed Vehicle Theft Min Imputed Vehicle Theft Max Imputed Vehicle Theft 1 22 21.99 22.91 22.91 18.55 24.00 2 22 22.04 22.80 25.20 14.40 26.40 3 22 22.01 21.33 21.33 12.00 29.33 4 22 22.07 22.50 22.50 9.00 31.50 5 22 22.04 22.29 22.29 6.86 34.29 6 22 21.99 22.00 20.00 6.00 38.00 7 22 21.97 21.60 21.60 4.80 43.20 8 22 22.01 21.00 21.00 3.00 48.00 9 22 22.08 24.00 24.00 0.00 52.00 10.3.2 10-12 months missing In cases where there are more than 9 months of data missing, the current imputation method replaces the entire year of data for that agency with the average of the crime for agencies who reported 12 months of data, are in the same state and in the same population group as the given agency. Considering that when an agency reports data it tends to report every month of the year - and about a quarter of agencies still do not report any months of data - this is a far bigger issue than when agencies are missing 1-9 months of data. The imputation process is also far worse here. Whereas with 1-9 months missing the results were at least based on the own agency’s data, and were actually not terribly wrong (depending on the specific agency and crime patterns) when only a small number of months were missing, the imputation for 10+ months missing is nonsensical. It assumes that these agencies are much like similarly sized agencies in the same state. There are two major problems here. First, similarly sized agencies are based on the population group which is quite literally just a category indicating how big the agency is when grouped into rather arbitrary categories. These categories can range quite far - with agencies having millions more people than other agencies in the same category in some cases - so in most cases “similarly sized” agencies are not that similarly sized. The second issue is simply the assumption that population is all that important to crime rates. Population is certainly important to crime counts; New York City is going to have many more crimes than small towns purely due to its huge population, even though NYC has a low crime rate. But there is still huge variation in crimes among cities of the same or similar size as crime tends to concentrate in certain areas. So replacing an agency’s annual crime counts with that or other agencies (even the average of other agencies) will give you a very wrong count. For this method of replacing missing data to be accurate agencies in the same population group in each state would need to have very similar crime counts. Otherwise it is assuming that missing agencies are just average (literally) in terms of crime. This again assumes that missing data is missing at random, which is unlikely to be true. In each of the below examples we use data from 2018 Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest and use only agencies whose final month reported was December. This makes it the actual agencies in each population group that would replace agencies that are missing 10 or more months of data in 2018. As agencies can - and do - report different numbers of months each year, these numbers would be a little different if using any year other than 2018. For each population group we’ll look at the mean, median, and maximum number of murders plus aggravated assaults with a gun.61 This is essentially a measure of the most serious violent crimes as the difference between gun assaults and murders is, to some degree, a matter of luck (e.g. where the person is shot can make the difference between an assault and a murder).62 This is actually not available in NACJD’s county-level UCR data as they don’t separate gun assaults from other aggravated assaults, though that data is available in the agency-level UCR data. If we see a wide range in the number of murders+gun-assaults in the below table, that’ll indicate that this method of imputing missing data is highly flawed. Table 10.7 shows these values for all agencies in the United States who reported 12 months of data (based on the “December last month reported” definition) in 2018. The actual imputation process only looks at agencies in the same state, but this is still information at seeing broad trends - and we’ll look at two specific states below. Column 1 shows each of the population groups in the data while the remaining columns show the mean, median, minimum, and maximum number of murders+gun-assaults in 2018, respectively.63 For each population group there is a large range of values, as seen from the minimum and maximum values. There are also large differences in the mean and median values for larger (25,000+ population) agencies, particularly when compared to the top and bottom of the range of values.64 Using this imputation method will, in most cases (but soon we’ll see an instance where there’s an exception) provide substantially different values than the real (but unknown) values. Table 10.7: The mean, median, minimum, and maximum agency size nationwide for all population groups in the 2018 Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrests data. Population Group Mean Murder + Gun Assault Median Murder + Gun Assault Minimum Murder + Gun Assault Max Murder + Gun Assault City Under 2,500 0 0 0 108 City 2,500-9,999 1 0 0 55 City 10,000-24,999 6 2 0 220 City 25,000-49,999 13 4 0 381 City 50,000-99,999 34 15 0 608 City 100,000-249,999 131 64 1 1,235 City 250,000+ 1,093 638 4 6,209 MSA Counties And MSA State Police 19 3 -1 1,701 Non-MSA Counties And Non-MSA State Police 3 1 0 295 To better see the distribution, Figure 10.7 shows boxplots for the rate per 100,000 population of murders+gun-assaults in each population group in 2018. Since there can’t be a rate without any population, this excludes all agencies with a population of zero. To make the graph simpler to see, it also excludes all agencies with a rate about 500, which is 57 agencies. Each population group has a relatively large range of values with the size of the boxplot growing as the size of the population group increases. This means that there are a wider variety of rates in larger population groups than in smaller population groups. Each population group also has a good number of agencies that are outliers with a much higher rate than is normal. Figure 10.7: Boxplots showing the distribution of annual murders+gun-assaults for each population group for all agencies that reported December data in 2018. Since the actual imputation process looks only at agencies in the same state, we’ll look at two example states - Texas and Maine - and see how trends differ from nationally. These states are chosen as Texas is a very large (both in population and in number of jurisdictions) state with some areas of high crime while Maine is a small, more rural state with very low crime. Table 10.8 shows results in Texas. Here, the findings are very similar to that of Table 10.7. While the numbers are different, and the maximum value is substantially smaller than using all agencies in the country, the basic findings of a wide range of values - especially at larger population groups - is the same. Table 10.8: The mean, median, minimum, and maximum agency size for agencies in Texas for all population groups in the 2018 Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrests data. Population Group Mean Murder + Gun Assault Median Murder + Gun Assault Minimum Murder + Gun Assault Max Murder + Gun Assault City Under 2,500 0 0 0 6 City 2,500-9,999 2 1 0 17 City 10,000-24,999 7 5 0 38 City 25,000-49,999 17 13 0 61 City 50,000-99,999 37 27 1 141 City 100,000-249,999 105 77 12 467 City 250,000+ 1,343 669 76 4,919 MSA Counties And MSA State Police 43 6 0 1,701 Non-MSA Counties And Non-MSA State Police 2 1 0 28 Now we’ll look at data from Maine, as shown in Table 10.9. Here, results are much better: there is a narrow range in values meaning that the imputation would be very similar to the real values. This is driven mainly by Maine being a tiny state, with only one city larger than 50,000 people (Portland) and Maine being an extremely safe state so most places have zero murders+gun-assaults. In cases like this, where both crime and population size are consistent across the state (which is generally caused by everywhere having low crime), this imputation process can work well. Table 10.9: The mean, median, minimum, and maximum agency size for agencies in Maine for all population groups in the 2018 Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrests data.

This is the conclusion that Maltz and Targonski had in 2002 in their paper examining the data and is, in my opinion, the conclusion that still holds today as the problems have not improved (or even changed since 2002). There are two main problems: distributing crimes for agencies in multiple counties and missing data. The first, given UCR data constraints, seems unfixable though is not a problem for agencies in only one county. For the second, if an imputation method was used that properly (i.e. got as close to the right answer as possible) handled missing data that would solve this issue. Given the decades of data and agencies that release their own crime data on their websites that can be used as a check on how close imputed data is to the real data (as some agencies, such as Philadelphia in 2019, don’t report all months of data to the UCR but still release incident-level data publicly on their city’s ‘open data’ websites) this is a solvable problem.65 Missing data is not a problem only in criminology, and is actually addressed in some criminology papers, so the fact that so much research relies on this data that does such a poor job of handling missing data and literally assumes that crime is not at all concentrated is a sorry testament to this field.66 We can do better. Even for county-level agencies such as Sheriff’s Offices, the data is only for crimes in that agency’s jurisdiction. So the county sheriff reports crimes that they responded to but not crimes within the county that other agencies, such as a city police force, responded to.↩︎ Because the county-level data imputes missing months, this dataset is only available at the annual-level, not at the monthly level.↩︎ These files are known on NACJD’s website as “Uniform Crime Reporting Program Data: County-Level Detailed Arrest and Offense Data.”↩︎ To be very clear, this chapter isn’t a critique of NACJD, which is a great organization with a very talented team, but merely of a single dataset that they released using imputation methods from decades ago.↩︎ For New York City specifically NACJD does distribute to all five counties, and does so by county population.↩︎ Hopefully the warnings deterred at least some people.↩︎ I used to have a Google Scholar alert for UCR papers but turned it off since so many papers either used my data but didn’t cite me, used the data improperly, or both.↩︎ Given economist’s policy of not citing other fields it’s likely that they haven’t read Maltz and Targonski’s paper. Normally I’d be concerned with criticizing entire fields, but no economist will read this as I’m not an economist myself so it’s fine.↩︎ I note these differences not to join the ego-driven feud between the fields. As a criminologist who currently works in a political science department, these feuds are quite stupid. I note it, however, to show that this data usage is partially driven by subcultures within fields. For example, criminology has long known about which may explain why it is more commonly used in non-criminology fields. It is therefore important for researchers to talk to (or collaborate with {though to be clear I’m not volunteering or requesting to collaborate with you}) people who have content-expertise about the data that you’re using. And that open communication between the fields (including collaborations and submitting to journals from fields other than your own) will strengthen both fields.↩︎ Even though these are unusual agencies, in real analyses using UCR data at the county-level you’d like want to include them. Or justify why you’re not including them.↩︎ This is actually more than I need to run to get the same results but it’s easier to run many simulations than to math out how many I actually need to find all possible combinations of missing months.↩︎ Aggravated assaults with a gun include but are not limited to shootings. The gun does not need to be fired to be considered an aggregated assault.↩︎ Attempted murders are considered aggravated assaults in the UCR.↩︎ The agency-level UCR data actually has more population groups than this list, but NACJD has grouped some together. Given that some states may have few (or no) agencies in a population group, combining more groups together does alleviate the problem of having no comparison cities but at the tradeoff of making the comparison less similar to the given agency.↩︎ The negative number for minimum crimes in the Non-MSA Counties and Non-MSA State Police is due to a reporting quirk of UCR, covered in Chapter 2, and is not a mistake in the data.↩︎ But not by me, so please don’t ask.↩︎ There are also a good number of criminology papers that try to interpolate missing data from survey papers, which in general I think is a mistake since they often assume that the data is missing at random.↩︎ "],["overview-of-the-data.html", "Chapter 11 Overview of the Data 11.1 Problems with NIBRS 11.2 Crimes included in NIBRS 11.3 Differences from UCR data 11.4 A summary of each segment file 11.5 Which agencies report data 11.6 How to identify a particular agency (ORI codes) 11.7 The data as you get it from the FBI", " Chapter 11 Overview of the Data Nearly a century ago the FBI started collecting data on crime that occurred in the United States as a way to better understand and respond to crime. This data, the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program Data, is a monthly count of the number of crime incidents (in cases where more than one crime happens per incident, only the most serious crime is included) in each police agency that reports data.67 Other than for homicides (which provides info about each victim and offender), only the number of crimes that occurred is included. So we know, for example, the number of robberies in a city but nothing about who the victims or offenders were, when in that month (day or time of day) the robberies occurred, or the type of location where they happened. To address these limitations the FBI started a new dataset in 1991, the National Incident-Based Reporting System data - which is known by its abbreviation NIBRS - and is the topic of this book. Relative to the FBI’s UCR data there are far fewer “weird things” in NIBRS data. Still, we’ll cover instances of the “weirdness” in the data, such as the why crime always goes up on the 1st of the month, or why there are more crimes at noon than at nearly all other hours of the day. We’ll also be discussing how much of the detailed information that should be available in the data is missing, and when that affects which questions we can answer. NIBRS data provides detailed information on every crime reported to the police, including victim and offender demographics, whether the offender was arrested (and the type of arrest it was), what date and time of day (by hour only) it happened on, the victim-offender relationship, and the crime location (as a location type, not the exact address). It also covers a far wider range of crimes than UCR data did. With the exception of UCR data on assaults against police officers, all NIBRS data can be converted back to UCR data, making it fully backwards compatible and, therefore, comparable to UCR data. In many ways NIBRS data is a massive improvement over UCR data. This data allows for a deeper understanding of crime and it has led to an explosion of research that allows a far more detailed analysis of crime and crime-policies than the blunt UCR data. However, there is a major limitation to this data: most agencies don’t use it. According to the FBI only about 8,500 police agencies, covering about 45% of the US population, reported NIBRS data in 2019 (the latest year currently available). This is fewer than half of the about 18,000 police agencies in the United States. This is an even larger problem than it seems as the agencies that do report - especially in earlier years of the data - are disproportionately small and rural. So we’re missing out of data from most major cities. A number of states don’t have any agencies reporting, making this data relatively biased at least in terms of geography and city size. Even so, the FBI has said that they are moving entirely to NIBRS data starting in 2021, and will no longer even collect UCR data. While NIBRS can be converted to UCR data, meaning we can have consistent statistics over time, for agencies that don’t report to NIBRS, we have no information on their crimes. In effect, unless the majority of agencies suddenly switch to NIBRS - which, given that the high level of detail relative to UCR data makes moving to NIBRS a costly and timely switch - we will be flying blind for most crime in the country. 11.1 Problems with NIBRS There are three major problems with NIBRS data, with the first two related to the lack of reporting. First, we are potentially looking at a massive loss of data when UCR data ends in 2020 - it takes over a year for data to be released so even though I’m writing this in Spring 2021, 2019 UCR and NIBRS data are the latest years available. 2020 data won’t be released by the FBI until September or October of this year. Considering the huge crime changes during 2020 - and the latest evidence suggests that the violent crime increase is continuing (and in places even accelerating) in 2021 - losing standardized crime data for most cities (and especially the largest cities) is a very bad thing. Moving the majority of agencies over to NIBRS so quickly may also risk the integrity of the data.68 As they rush to comply with the FBI’s order that they only will accept NIBRS data, there will likely be more mistakes made and erroneous data included in NIBRS data. This will likely include both knowledge problems with agencies not understanding how to properly report data and the simply issue of typos leading to wrong info being entered. Though the FBI does do quality assurance checks, no check is foolproof - and their checks in UCR data have still allowed clearly impossible data to be entered (e.g. millions of arsons reported in a month in a small town). So while I always urge caution when using any data - caution that should be accompanied by a thorough examination of your data before using it - NIBRS data from 2020 and beyond merits extra attention. The second problem is that even if suddenly all agencies do start reporting in 2021, we’d only have a single year of data available. Even for agencies that already report, we generally don’t have too many years of data for them. This really limits the kind of research since we can do since it’s hard to know if a finding is based on a trend or is just a weird outlier without having many years of data available. For the agencies where 2020 is the first year, we’ll likely to have to wait a few years to even figure out what “normal” crime is supposed to look like. This means that for the next several years at least we’ll be mostly using NIBRS data as UCR-like datasets, aggregated to the month- or year-level so we can compare it with UCR data from the past. Luckily, this problem will be alleviated the longer we wait as more years of data will become available. The final issue is that this data is massive. A single year of 2019 data - with &lt;50% of agencies reporting, and few large agencies reporting - has about 6.5 million crime incidents recorded. Since each crime incident can have multiple victims, offenders, and crimes, there are more rows for these datasets.69 Once all agencies report - though it’s doubtful that’ll ever occur, though we may come close - we’re looking at tens of millions of rows per year. And even now if we wanted to look at a decade of data we’re going to be dealing with over 50 million rows of data. So this data requires both good hardware - a strong laptop or server is necessary - and good programming skills, which most academics sorely lack. If you can, buy more RAM for your computer as that’s much easier than having to write complicated code to deal with large data. I want to stress this point. If you intend to work with NIBRS data for any significant amount of time you should buy the most RAM your computer can use (RAM is very cheap now) and install it. I’d recommend at least 16GB but more is better. While computers can handle NIBRS with less RAM, it’ll just lead to you spending more time writing code to deal with big data and it’ll inevitably still run slower than buying extra RAM. 11.1.1 NIBRS allows for different units of analysis A major benefit of UCR data is that you have very limited choices. If you wanted to measure crime your only choice was to use their monthly aggregated police agency-level data. This makes working with the data relatively easy, even though what work you could do was limited. NIBRS data takes an opposite approach. It provides detailed data and largely leaves it up to the users for what to do with it. This flexibility is also a curse. For every use of this data you will need to decide which unit of analysis to use - and NIBRS provides a few options. If you’re interested in measuring rape you could do so in several different ways, each of which addresses a different part of crime measurement and will lead to different answers to your questions: the number of crime incidents, the number of victims, the number of offenders, and the number of crimes. Let’s use an incident where four men rape a single woman as an example. Even if we somehow solve the issue of victims not reporting their rapes, we still have a few different ways of even measuring rape. First, we can follow the old UCR measure of incident-level and say that this is one rape since only one crime incident occurred (even though there were multiple offenders). Second, we could look at the victim-level, which again is one rape as there was only one victim. Or at the offender-level, which now has four rapes since each offender would be responsible the rape. Finally we could look at the offense-level. Even though the four men were involved in the rape incident, potentially not all of them would have actually committed the rape (and would have the offense in NIBRS data as something else such as assault or attempted rape if they didn’t complete the act). Some could have acted as, for example, lookouts so would be involved with the incident but not the rape. So through this measure we’d have between one and four rapes, depending on the exact circumstances. Each way of measuring could lead to substantially different understandings of rape, and this is the kind of complexity that we’ll have to wrangle with when using NIBRS data. Since this data includes multiple crimes in each criminal incident, unlike the UCR which includes only the most serious crime per incident, we can also measure crime in its relationship to other crimes. In the above example we’re interested in rapes. The UCR method would measure it as the number of rapes in incidents where rape is the most serious charge (“most serious” is based on the FBI’s hierarchy of offenses, following what they call the Hierarchy Rule) but this undercounts crimes where rape happened alongside another, more serious, offense.70 So we can also look at incidents where any offense that occurred was a rape. Using this method we can examine how often rape - or any crime we’re interested in - co-occurs with other offenses, which provides more information on how crime happens that looking at one crime alone. For example, we could see how often burglary-rapes occur, a crime which is far different than spousal-rape, and in UCR data we’d have no way of differentiating the two. In most cases, however, only one offense occurs per criminal incident (at least as reported in the data), so the opportunity to explore co-occurrence is relatively limited. 11.2 Crimes included in NIBRS NIBRS data contains far more crime categories than in the UCR data, particularly far more than UCR crime data which contained only eight crimes (and their subcategories of crimes). It also includes several more crime categories than in the UCR arrest data which is far more expansive than the UCR crime dataset. Compared to UCR data, however, there are occasionally more steps you must take to get the same crime category. For example, UCR crime data has the number of gun assaults each month. NIBRS data has the number of aggravated assaults only, but has a variable indicating what weapon the offender used. So you can find out how many aggravated assaults used a gun, giving you the same data as in the UCR, but you need to take extra steps to get there. Likewise the UCR arrest data has the number of people arrested for selling drugs (broken down into a few different categories of drugs). NIBRS data has if the crime type was a “drug/narcotic violation” which means any crime having to deal with drugs possession, sale, or manufacturing, and excluding drug equipment crimes. We then have to look first at the subcategory of offenses to see if the arrest was for possession, for sale, for manufacturing, or some other kind of drug crime. The final step to be comparable to UCR data is to look at the type of drug involved in the crime. You’ll often have to do steps like this during NIBRS research. NIBRS data is available in multiple files that all (for the most part) correspond with each other so you’ll tend to have to combine them together to get the complete data you want. The crimes included in NIBRS are broken into two categories: Group A and Group B crimes. 11.2.1 Group A crimes The first set of crimes included are Group A crimes and these are really the main crimes included in NIBRS. For each of these crimes we have full data on the victim, the offender, the offense, any property stolen or damaged (or for drug crimes, seized by the police), and info about the arrestee (if any). Of course, not all of this data may be available (e.g. information on the offender is unknown) so there can be significant amounts of missing data, but each crime incident does have corresponding files with this information. The complete list of Group A crimes is below. I’ve bolded the Index Crimes which are a flawed, but ubiquitous measure of crime used in the UCR crime data as the main measure of crime in the United States. The Index Crimes are murder, rape (sexual assault with an object and sodomy are only considered rape using the FBI new definition that began in 2013), aggravated assault, robbery (these four are the “Violent Index Crimes”), burglary, motor vehicle theft, and theft (these are the “Property Index Crimes”. Theft here is broken down into several types of theft like purse-snatching and shoplifting. In the UCR crime dataset it is only “theft”.). Arson is also technically an Index Crime (arson is considered a property crime) but is generally excluded. Using Index Crimes as your measure of crime is a bad idea (see here for more on this) but it’s good that all of the Index Crimes are available in NIBRS so we have continuity of data from when agencies move from UCR to NIBRS. Aggravated Assault All Other Larceny Animal Cruelty Arson Assisting Or Promoting Prostitution Betting/Wagering Bribery Burglary/Breaking And Entering Counterfeiting/Forgery Credit Card/ATM Fraud Destruction/Damage/Vandalism of Property Drug Equipment Violations Drug/Narcotic Violations Embezzlement Extortion/Blackmail False Pretenses/Swindle/Confidence Game Fondling (Incident Liberties/Child Molest) Gambling Equipment Violations Hacking/Computer Invasion Human Trafficking - Commercial Sex Acts Human Trafficking - Involuntary Servitude Identity Theft Impersonation Incest Intimidation Justifiable Homicide Kidnapping/Abduction Motor Vehicle Theft Murder/Non-negligent Manslaughter Negligent Manslaughter Operating/Promoting/Assisting Gambling Pocket-Picking Pornography/Obscene Material Prostitution Purchasing Prostitution Purse-Snatching Rape Robbery Sexual Assault With An Object Shoplifting Simple Assault Sodomy Sports Tampering Statutory Rape Stolen Property Offenses (Receiving, Selling, Etc.) Theft From Building Theft From Coin-Operated Machine Or Device Theft From Motor Vehicle Theft of Motor Vehicle Parts/Accessories Weapon Law Violations Welfare Fraud Wire Fraud 11.2.2 Group B crimes The other set of crimes included in NIBRS are called Group B crimes. For these crimes, only the arrestee segment is available, meaning that we have far more limited data on these incidents than for Group A crimes. Unlike Group A, we only have data here when a person was arrested for the crime, so we don’t know how often they occur without an arrest made. These crimes are considered Group B rather than Group A, according to the FBI, because they are less serious or less common than Group A crimes. This isn’t really true though. They are certainly less serious than the most serious Group A crimes but include offenses more serious than some Group A crimes. For example, DUIs can potentially lead to serious injury if they crash into someone (if they did then that would likely be considered a charge like manslaughter or assault, but DUIs still have the potential to cause great harm) and peeping toms are an invasion of privacy and can cause serious distress to their victims. Relative to crimes like shoplifting, Group B offenses can indeed be more serious. Group B crimes are also quite common, particularly the catch-all category All Other Offenses. One way I like to think of Group B crimes is that they’re mostly - excluding peeping tom - victim-less crimes, or more specifically crimes without a specific victim. For example, in DUIs there’s no individual victim; public drunkenness may disturb certain people around the event but they aren’t the victims of the drunkenness. There are Group A crimes where the same is true, such as drug offenses, but I think this is a helpful way of thinking about Group B crimes. All Other Offenses - excludes traffic violations Bad Checks Curfew/Loitering/Vagrancy Violations Disorderly Conduct Driving Under The Influence (DUI) Drunkenness Family Offenses, Nonviolent Liquor Law Violations Peeping Tom Runaway - only for minors (data ends in 2011) Trespass of Real Property 11.3 Differences from UCR data While NIBRS data is a far more expansive and detailed dataset than the UCR data, in most cases you can convert NIBRS to UCR which allows for continuation of data over time. So the switch from UCR to NIBRS adds a lot of information but loses relatively little. That relatively little amount of difference, however, can impact the types of questions we can ask so they are detailed below. 11.3.1 NIBRS does not have unfounded crimes In UCR data, which provides monthly counts of crimes (as well as more detailed info on hate crimes and homicides, and monthly counts of arrests), there is a count of “unfounded” crimes in each month. An unfounded crime is just one which was previously reported and then new evidence finds out that it never actually occurred (or that it isn’t for the crime that was reported). For example, if you misplace your wallet but think it is stolen you may call the police and report it stolen. This would be recorded in UCR data as a theft. If you then find your wallet and tell the police, then it would be changed to an unfounded crime since the reported theft never actually happened. NIBRS data does not include unfounded data at all so you don’t know how many reported crimes turn out to not be true. In practice, this doesn’t matter too much as unfounded crimes are rare, constituting generally under 2% of each crime type. The major exception is in rape, where some agencies report that over 10% of rapes in certain years are unfounded. For more on this issue with rape, please see this section of my UCR book here. Given that UCR data already has major issue with rape data, including both changes in the definition of rape in 2013 and evidence that the number of cleared rapes is greatly exaggerated (see this report from ProPublica for more info on this), losing unfounded rapes means losing a not insignificant number of likely real rapes. Unfounded crimes are also a way that the UCR used to identify justifiable homicides and when police killed someone. But that way was not always used properly and NIBRS data already includes justifiable homicide as a crime category so this isn’t a problem. 11.3.1.1 NIBRS does not have negative numbers Negative numbers in UCR data are because when a crime is reported and then later unfounded, in the month that it is unfounded it is classified as -1 crimes. This is so over the long term (i.e. more than a single month) the positive (but incorrect, and therefore later unfounded) reports and the negative reports to deal with unfounding would equal out so you have the actual number of crimes. In practice though this tended to end up confusing users - though only users who didn’t read the manual. Since NIBRS does not have unfounded data, and since it isn’t aggregated beyond the incident-level anyways, there are no negative numbers in NIBRS data. 11.3.2 Less information on assaults against officers One of the UCR datasets, the Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted (LEOKA) has monthly information on the number of police officers killed and assaulted for each reporting agency. For officers killed it only tells us how many officers were killed “feloniously” which basically means they were murdered or killed accidentally, such as in a car crash. While still only monthly counts, the info on assaults is far more detailed. It includes, for example, the type of call the officer was on during the assault (e.g. responding to a robbery, transporting a prisoner), the hour it occurred, what weapon the offender used, and whether the officer was injured. The data also included information on how many people were employed by the agency as of Halloween of that year, with breakdowns by if that employee is a sworn officer or not, and by the gender of the employee. NIBRS data keeps some of this info. We know if the victim of a crime is a police officer, what injuries they sustained, and any weapon the offender was using. We don’t have any info on the call type the officer was on or information about the number of employees in that department with the same breakdown as in LEOKA. So, assuming that agencies that reported data to LEOKA report at the same rate in NIBRS, we’d still be losing information about assaults on police officers. The FBI has said that they’re retiring UCR data after 2020, and LEOKA is one of the UCR datasets so assumably this dataset would also be retired, leaving just NIBRS for information on crimes against police officers.71 11.4 A summary of each segment file NIBRS data is often discussed - and is used - as if it were a single file with all of this information available. But it actually comes as multiple different files that each provide different information about a crime incident, including at different levels of analysis so users must clean each segment before merging them together. In this section we’ll discuss each of the segments and how they are related to each other. First, keep in mind that NIBRS is at its core an incident-level dataset (hence the “Incident-Based” part of its name). Everything that we have stems from the incident, even though we can get more detailed and look at, for example, individual victims in an incident or even offenses within an incident. Figure 11.1 shows the seven main segments and how they relate to each other.72 There are also three segments called “window segments” - there is one for arrestees, one of exceptional clearances (i.e. police could have made an arrest but didn’t for some reason but still consider the case closed), and one for property - that do not have an associated segment with them, they only have the information available in the given “window” segment. We’ll talk about window segments more in Section 11.4.7 below. Figure 11.1: The association of each segment file in the NIBRS dataset. The first two boxes in Figure 11.1, colored in orange, are not part of NIBRS but are part of the data generating process. First, obviously, a crime has to occur. The police then have to learn about the crime. This can happen in two ways. First, they can discover it themselves while on patrol. This is common in crimes such as drug possession or sale as well as any crime that occurs outdoors, which is largely where police are able to observe behavior. The second way is that the victim or witness to a crime reports it. So if they call the police to report a crime, the police learn about it from that call. We don’t actually know from the data how the police learned of a crime but it’s important to think about this data generating process when using the data. Alongside the crime being reported (or discovered) to the police, agencies must then report the crime to NIBRS. All crimes that occur in that agency’s jurisdiction should be reported, but that’s not always the case. Since reporting is voluntary (at least nationally, though some states do require agencies to report data), agencies are free to report as many or as few crimes as they wish. This often occurs when agencies report only parts of the year, excluding certain months, so you should ensure that the agency reported data for each month you’re interested in. Once a crime occurs and is reported to the police, it can be recorded to NIBRS in two ways, depending on the type of crime that occurred. If it is one of the Group B crimes, then we only get a Group B Arrestee Segment which is the same as the normal arrestee segment which we discuss in more detail below as well as in Chapter 16. In this segment we have useful variables including the type of arrest (e.g. arrested by a warrant), what crime was committed, demographics of the arrestee, and weapon use. However, we’re missing a wealth of information that is available in the other segments. When the crime is one of the Group A crimes, we get all of this additional information. For Group A crimes, we get every other segment, starting with the Administrative Segment. The Administrative Segment is largely a meta-segment - it provides information about other segments. The Administrative Segment is the only incident-level segment of the collection and provides information that is consistent across every offense in the incident such as the incident date and time (in hours of the day). It also includes the type of exceptional clearance for the incident, if the incident was exceptionally cleared. The key part of this segment, however, is that it tells you how many of the Offense, Offender, Victim, and Property segments that are associated with this incident. There are always at least one of these segments per incident, but can potentially be multiple of each segment. These other segments do exactly what their name suggests, providing information about the offenses, offender, victims, and stolen or damaged property for each crime incident. Each of these segments, including the Administrative Segment, have the agency identifier code (the ORI code which is discussed on Section 11.6) and an incident number (which is just a randomly generated unique identifier for that incident) so you can merge the files together. Please note that the incident number of only unique within an agency. So there can - and are - incident numbers that are identical across different agencies but are for different incidents. To avoid this issue, make sure you match based on both the ORI code and the incident number (or make a new variable with just combines the ORI code and incident number together). At the bottom is the Arrestee Segment which is only available when a person was arrested for that incident. This provides a bit more detailed data than the Offender Segment for everyone who was arrested for the incident. Now, in reality arrestees aren’t necessarily a subset of offenders as some people arrested may not be the ones included in the offender data. Consider, for example, a crime where police initially think two people committed it but end up arresting three people for the crime. The third person would be in the arrestee file but not the offender file. However, in this data there is never a case where there are more arrestees than offenders so it appears that if an offender is arrested who wasn’t previously known to the police, they add a corresponding offender segment row for that arrestee. 11.4.1 Administrative Segment The Administrative Segment provides information about the incident itself, such as how many victims or offenders there were. In practice this means that it tells us how many other segments - offense, offender, victim, and arrestee segments - there are for this particular incident. It also has several important variables at the incident-level such as what hour of the day the incident occurred and whether the incident date variable is actually just the date the incident was reported. Finally, it tells us whether the case was cleared exceptionally and, if so, what type of exceptional clearance it was. This can tell us, for example, how many crimes were cleared because the offender died or the victim refused to cooperate. As the UCR data doesn’t differentiate between normal clearances (i.e. arrest the offender) and exceptional clearances, this provides a far deeper understanding of case outcomes. 11.4.2 Offense Segment This segment provides information about the offense that occurred, and each incident can have multiple offenses. This data tells you which offense occurred and for a subset of offenses it also provides a more detailed subcategory of offense, allowing a deeper dive into what exactly happened. For example, for animal abuse there are four subcategories of offenses: simple/gross neglect of an animal, intentional abuse or torture, animal sexual abuse (bestiality), and organized fighting of animals such as dog or cock fights. This segment also says what date the crime occurred on, where the crime occurred - in categories such as residence or sidewalk rather than exact coordinates in a city - whether the offender is suspected of using drugs, alcohol, or “computer equipment” (which includes cell phones) during the crime, and which weapon was used. In cases where the weapon was a firearm it says whether that weapon was fully automatic or not. It also provides information on if the crime was a hate crime by including a variable on the bias motivation (if any) of the offender. This is based on evidence that the crime was motivated, at least in part, by the victim’s group (e.g. race, sexuality, religion, etc.). There are 34 possible bias motivations and while hate crimes could potentially be motivated by bias against multiple groups, this data only allows for a single bias motivation. 11.4.3 Offender Segment As might be expected, the Offender Segment provides information about who the offender is for each incident, though this is limited to only demographic variables. So we know the age, sex, and race of each offender but nothing else. This means that important variables such as criminal history, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and motive are missing. In the Victim Segment we learn about the relationship between the victim and offender, and in the Offense Segment we learn which weapon (if any) the offender used. So there is some other data on the offender in other segments but it’s quite limited. This data has one row per offender so incidents with multiple offenders have multiple rows. In cases where there is no information about the offender there will be a single row where all of the offender variables will be “unknown.” In these cases having a single row for the offender is merely a placeholder and doesn’t necessarily mean that there was only one offender for that incident. However, there’s no indicator for when this is a placeholder and when there was actually one offender but whose demographic info is unknown. 11.4.4 Victim Segment The Victim Segment provides data at the victim-level and includes information about who the victim is and their relationship to offenders. This data tells us what “type” of victim it is with the type meaning if they are a police officer, a civilian (called an “Individual” victim and basically any person who isn’t a police officer), a business, the government, etc. It also includes the standard demographics variables in other segments - age, race, sex, ethnicity - as well as whether the victim is a resident (i.e. do they live there?) of the jurisdiction where they were victimized. We also learn from this data what types of injuries (if any) the victim suffered as a result of the crime. This is limited to physical injuries - excluding important outcomes such as mental duress or PTSD - but allows for a much better measure of harm from crime than simply assuming (or using past studies that tend to be old and only look at the cost of crime) what harm comes from certain offenses. There are seven possible injury types (including no injury at all) and victims can report up to five of these injuries so we have a fairly detailed measure of victim injury. One highly interesting variable in this segment is the relationship between the victim and the offender (for up to 10 offenders). This includes, for example, if the victim was the offender’s wife, their child, employee, or if the stranger was unknown to them, with 27 total possible relationship categories. You can use this to determine which incidents were crimes by strangers, identify domestic violence, or simply learn about the victim-offender relationship for certain types of crimes. This variable is only available when the victim is a police officer or an “individual.” This makes some sense though there could actually be cases where non-human victims (e.g. businesses, religious organizations) do have a relationship with the offender such as an employee stealing from a store. Related to the victim-offender relationship, this segment provides a bit of information about the motive for the crime. For aggravated assaults and homicides, there is a variable with the “circumstance” of the offense which is essentially the reason why the crime occurred. For example, possible circumstances include arguments between people, hunting accidents, child playing with weapon, and mercy killings. 11.4.5 Arrestee and Group B Arrestee Segment The Arrestee Segment has information on the person arrested in an incident and has a number of variables that look at same as in previous segments but with subtle differences. This segment covers the arrestee’s age, sex, and race, ethnicity, and residency status (of the city, not as a United States citizen). Age, sex, and race are also in the Offender Segment but can differ as not all offenders are arrested. It also says the crime the arrestee was arrested for (which in some cases is different than the crime committed in the offense since an arrest can clear multiple incidents), the weapon carried during the arrest (which may be different than the weapon used during the offense) and if this weapon (if it is a firearm) was an automatic weapon. There are a few completely new variables including the date of the arrest and the type of arrest. The type of arrest is simply whether the person was arrested by police who viewed the crime, if the arrest followed an arrest warrant or a previous arrest (i.e. arrested for a different crime and then police find out you also committed this one so they consider you arrested for this one too), and whether the person was cited by police and ordered to appear in court but not formally taken into custody. Finally, for juvenile arrestees it says whether arrestees were “handled within the department” which means they were released without formal sanctions or were “referred to other authorities” such as juvenile or criminal court, a welfare agency, or probation or parole department (for those on probation or parole). 11.4.6 Property Segment The Property Segment provides a bit more info than would be expected from the name. For each item involved in the crime it tells you what category that items falls into, with 68 total categories of types of property (including “other”) ranging from explosives and pets to money and alcohol. It also tells you the estimated value of that item. This data covers more than just items stolen during a crime. For each item it tells you what happened to that item such as if it was stolen, damaged, seized by police (such as illegal items like drugs), recovered by police, or burned during an arson. For drug offenses it includes the drugs seized by police. For these offenses, the data tells us the type of drug, with 16 different drug categories ranging from specific ones like marijuana or heroin to broader categories such as “other narcotics”. There can be up to three different drugs included in this data - if the person has more than three types of drugs seized then the third drug category will simply indicate that there are more than three drugs, so we learn what the first two drugs are but not the third or greater drugs are in these cases. For each drug we also know exactly how much was seized with one variable saying the amount the police found and another saying the units we should we reading that amount as (e.g. pills, grams, plants). 11.4.7 Window segments The final set of segments are the “Window” segments which are partial reports meaning that the incident doesn’t have all of the other segment files associated with it.73 There are three window segments Window Arrestee, Window Property, and Window Exceptional Clearance. All three are very rare relative to non-window data and are generally no more than several thousand incidents per year (the non-window data is several million per year). Window files are here when the crime occurred before the agency started reporting to NIBRS and then the arrest happened after they switched to NIBRS. 11.5 Which agencies report data So if this data has the same info (other than unfounded and negative crimes) as UCR data, but is also far more detailed, why do people ever use UCR data? Besides NIBRS being more complicated to use, far fewer agencies report NIBRS data than do UCR data. Nearly all agencies report crime data for UCR, though fewer do so for some of the UCR datasets such as arrests or arsons - for more, please see my UCR book. In comparison, fewer than half of agencies report to NIBRS, and these agencies are disproportionately smaller and more rural. Starting with 2021 data, the FBI has stopped collecting UCR data, instead only collecting NIBRS data. So if - and this is a very large if - many more agencies move to NIBRS in 2021, we’ll start having much more detail from a very representative sample of agencies.74 Even so, most research - especially policy analyses - requires many years of data so it’ll take many years before the full potential of NIBRS data can be realized. We’ll look here at how many agencies report at least one crime each year between 1991 - the first year of data - and 2019 - the latest year of data - as well as compare NIBRS reporting to UCR reporting. Figure 11.2 shows the number of agencies each year that reported at least one incident. Keep in mind that there are about 18,000 police agencies in the United States. Only a little over 600 agencies reported in 1991. This has grown pretty linearly, adding a few hundred agencies each year though that trend accelerated in recent years. In 2019, nearly 8,200 agencies reported at least some data to NIBRS. Compared to the estimated 18,000 police agencies in the United States, however, this is still fewer than half of agencies. The data shown here is potentially an overcount, however, as it includes agencies reporting any crime that year, even if they don’t report every month. Figure 11.2: The annual number of agencies reporting at least one incident in that year. Another way to look at reporting is comparing it to reporting to UCR. Figure 11.3 shows the number of agencies in each state that report NIBRS data in 2019. Since 2019 is the year with the most participation, this does overstate reporting for previous years. This map pretty closely follows a population map of the US. Texas had the most agencies, followed by Michigan and Ohio. The southern states have more agencies reporting than the lightly populated northern states. The issue here is that a number of states are in white, indicating that very few agencies reported. Indeed, four of the most populated states - California, New York, Florida, and New Jersey - don’t have any agencies at all that report NIBRS data. Figure 11.3: The number of agencies in each state that reported at least one crime in 2022 to NIBRS. Since the number of agencies in a state is partially just a factor of population, Figure 11.4 shows each state as a percent of agencies in that state that report to NIBRS that also reported to the UCR Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest (the “crime” dataset) in 2019.75 Not all agencies in the US reported to UCR in 2019 - and a small number reported to NIBRS but not UCR in 2019 - but this is a fairly good measure of reporting rates. Here the story looks a bit different than in the previous figure. Now we can tell that among north-western states and states along the Appalachian Mountains, nearly all agencies report. In total, 18 states have 90% or more of agencies that reported to UCR in 2019 also reporting to NIBRS. Thirteen agencies have fewer than 10% of agencies reporting to NIBRS that also reported to UCR, with 5 of these having 0% of agencies reporting. The remaining states average about 56% of agencies reporting. So when using NIBRS data, keep in mind that you have very good coverage of certain states, and very poor coverage of other states. And the low - or zero - reporting states are systematically high population states. Figure 11.4: Agencies in each state reporting at least one crime to NIBRS in 2022 as a percent of agencies that reported UCR Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrests data in 2022. For ease of reference, Table 11.1 shows the number of agencies in each state reporting to NIBRS and to UCR in 2019, and the percent shown in Figure 11.4. Table 11.1: The number of agencies in each state reporting to NIBRS and to UCR in 2019. Also shows NIBRS reporting in each state as a percent of UCR reporting.

An ORI is a unique ID code used to identify an agency.76 If we used the agency’s name we’d end up with some duplicates since there can be multiple agencies in the country (and in a state, those this is very rare) with the same name. For example, if you looked for the Philadelphia Police Department using the agency name, you’d find both the “Philadelphia Police Department” in Pennsylvania and the one in Mississippi. Each ORI is a 9-digit value starting with the state abbreviation (for some reason the FBI incorrectly puts the abbreviation for Nebraska as NB instead of NE) followed by 7 numbers. In the UCR data (another FBI data set) the ORI uses only a 7-digit code - with only the 5 numbers following the state abbreviation instead of 7. So the NIBRS ORI codes are sometimes called ORI9. For nearly all agencies, the only difference between the UCR ORI and the NIBRS ORI is that the NIBRS ORI has “00” at the end so it is technically 9 characters long but isn’t any more specific than the 7-character UCR ORI code. When dealing with specific agencies, make sure to use the ORI rather than the agency name to avoid any mistakes. For an easy way to find the ORI number of an agency, use this page on my site. Type an agency name or an ORI code into the search section and it will return everything that is a match. 11.7 The data as you get it from the FBI We’ll finish this overview of the NIBRS data by briefly talking about format of the data that is released by the FBI, before the processing done by myself or NACJD that converts the data to a type that software like R or Stata or Excel can understand. The FBI releases their data as fixed-width ASCII files which are basically just an Excel file but with all of the columns squished together. As an example, Figure 11.5 shows what the data looks like as you receive it from the FBI for the 1991 NIBRS data, the first year with data available. The way the FBI releases NIBRS data adds even more complications to using ASCII files. Since there are multiple segments in each NIBRS file you’d think that each segment would be its own file. But, no, the FBI gives you a single file with every segment stacked on top of each other. And, it’s “stacked” essentially in a random way where row 1 may be from a certain segment while the next row is from a different segment. Figure 11.5: Fixed-width ASCII file for the 1991 National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) dataset. You can think of this a little like chapters from a book. Normally chapter 1 is first, followed by chapter 2 and so on. And within each chapter are sentences that use proper punctuation so we can easily read it and know where one sentence ends and the next begins. The FBI’s NIBRS data basically removes all punctuation, cuts up every sentence and rearranges them in a random order and then hands it to you and says “read this.” This is a terrible way to present any data, but is what we’ve had ever since data began in 1991 and seems highly unlikely to change. The “fixed-width” part of the file type is how this works (the ASCII part basically means it’s a text file). Each row is the same width - literally the same number of characters, including blank spaces. Though each segment has a different width so you’ll first need to grab only the rows that correspond to a particular segment before you can read in that segment. So you must tell the software you are using to process this file - by literally writing code in something called a “setup file” which is basically just instructions for whatever software you use (R, SPSS, Stata, SAS can all do this) - which characters are certain columns. For example, in this data the first two character says which segment it is (07 means the Group B Arrestee segment) and the next two characters (in the setup file written as 3-4 since it is characters 3 through 4 [inclusive]) are the state number (01 is the state code for Alabama).77 So we can read this row as the first column indicating it is an Group B Arrestee segment, the second column indicating that it is for the state of Alabama, and so on for each of the remaining columns. To read in this data you’ll need a setup file that covers every column in the data (some software, like R, can handle just reading in the specific columns you want and don’t need to include every column in the setup file). The second important thing to know about reading in a fixed-width ASCII file is something called a “value label.”78 For example, in the above image we saw the characters 3-4 is the state and in the row we have the value “01” which means that the state is “Alabama.” Since this type of data is trying to be as small and efficient as possible, it often replaces longer values with shorter one and provides a translation for the software to use to convert it to the proper value when reading it. “Alabama” is more characters than “01” so it saves space to say “01” and just replace that with “Alabama” later on. So “01” would be the “value” and “Alabama” would be the “label” that it changes to once read. Fixed-width ASCII files may seem awful to you reading it today, and it is awful to use. It appears to be an efficient way to store data back many decades ago when data releases began but now is extremely inefficient - in terms of speed, file size, ease of use - compared to modern software so I’m not sure why they still release data in this format. For you, however, the important part to understand is not how exactly to read this type of data, but to understand that people who made this data publicly available (such as myself and the team at NACJD) must make this conversion process.79 This conversion process, from fixed-width ASCII to a useful format is the most dangerous step taken in using this data - and one that is nearly entirely unseen by researchers. Every line of code you write (or, for SPSS users, click you make) invites the possibility of making a mistake.80 The FBI does not provide a setup file with the fixed-width ASCII data so to read in this data you need to make it yourself.81 Each NIBRS segment has over a dozen columns and potentially dozens of value labels.82 A typo anywhere could have potentially far-reaching consequences, so this is a crucial weak point in the data cleaning process - and one in which I have not seen anything written about before.83 While I have been diligent in checking the setup files and my code to seek out any issues - and I know that NACJD has a robust checking process for their own work - that doesn’t mean our work is perfect. This data has been expanded since it began in 1929 to include information on arrests, hate crimes, and stolen property.↩︎ “Quickly” is a bit of a misnomer as agencies were free to report to NIBRS since it began in 1991 and the FBI had announced many years ago that they’d only collect NIBRS in 2021. Still, given that the majority of agencies don’t report to NIBRS and 2020 had a plague, the switch is likely to introduce issues and should be delayed.↩︎ While people generally refer to NIBRS just as “NIBRS data” it is actually a collection multiple different datasets all - with a few exceptions - corresponding to a single crime incident. For example, if you care about victim info you’ll look in the victim file called the “Victim Segment” (each of the datasets are called “Segments” since they are part of the whole picture of the crime incident) and likely will merge it with other data, such as when are where the crime occurred which is in the “Offense Segment”. In most cases you’ll merge together multiple datasets from the NIBRS collection to be able to answer the question that you have.↩︎ Based on the Hierarchy Rule, only murder is more serious.↩︎ If you have any evidence that they’re doing otherwise, please let me know.↩︎ There are also segments called “batch headers” which provide information about the agency such as the population under its jurisdiction, but we won’t cover those since they are agency-level and the same across each incident↩︎ I think the “window” part is a metaphor for while we have lots of info on other incidents, for window segments we have less info so it’s like looking through a narrow window. Personally, I find it a bit confusing.↩︎ I say representative sample as certainly not all agencies will report, even once UCR is no longer collected. It’ll take time for all agencies to report, and I doubt we’ll ever get to 100% of agencies.↩︎ This is the UCR dataset which has the highest reporting rate.↩︎ This is referred to as an “ORI”, “ORI code”, and “ORI number”, all of which mean the same thing.↩︎ We can see several rows down that we have a row starting with “01” which means it is an Administrative Segment, and then starting with “02” which is from the Offense Segment.↩︎ For most fixed-width ASCII files there are also missing values where it’ll have placeholder value such as -8 and the setup file will instruct the software to convert that to NA. NIBRS data, however, does not have this and does not indicate when values are missing in this manner.↩︎ For those interested in how to actually read in this type of data, please see my R package asciiSetupReader.↩︎ Even highly experienced programmers who are doing something like can make mistakes. For example, if you type out “2+2” 100 times - something extremely simple that anyone can do - how often will you mistype a character and get a wrong result? I’d guess that at least once you’d make a mistake.↩︎ They do provide the instructions in a PDF, but you still need to actually make the file yourself. You cannot use their instructions because setup files must be formatted in a very specific way and the PDF is not in this format/↩︎ In comparison to UCR data, this is far less complicated to make a setup file for, so the risk of mistakes is far lower.↩︎ Other than in my own UCR book.↩︎ "],["administrative-and-window-exceptional-clearance-segment.html", "Chapter 12 Administrative and Window Exceptional Clearance Segment 12.1 Important variables", " Chapter 12 Administrative and Window Exceptional Clearance Segment The Administrative Segment provides information about the incident itself, such as how many victims or offenders there were. In practice this means that it tells us how many other segments - offense, offender, victim, and arrestee segments - there are for this particular incident. It also has several important variables at the incident-level such as what hour of the day the incident occurred and whether the incident date variable is actually just the date the incident was reported. Finally, it tells us whether the case was cleared exceptionally and, if so, what type of exceptional clearance it was. This can tell us, for example, how many crimes were cleared because the offender died or the victim refused to cooperate. As the UCR data doesn’t differentiate between normal clearances (i.e. arrest the offender) and exceptional clearances, this provides a far deeper understanding of case outcomes. 12.1 Important variables In addition to the variables detailed below, this segment has the traditional agency and incident identifiers: the ORI code, the agency state, the year of this data, and the incident number. 12.1.1 The incident and report date An important variable, especially for policy analyses, is when the crime happened. NIBRS tells you both the date and the hour of the day for when the crime occurred. We’ll start with the date. We can convert the date a few different ways, such as daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly. We could use this precise date to do regression discontinuity studies where we look at days just before and just after some policy change or natural experiment. In this chapter we’ll look simply at the percent of crimes each month and each day of the month (overall, not within each month). Figure 12.1 shows the percent of crimes in the 2022 NIBRS data each month. Past research has found that crimes are lowest when it is cold and highest when it is hot (and summer also comes with many teens and young adults out of school so have more free time to offend or be victimized). We find these same results with crime lowest in February and steadily increasing until it peaks in July and August, and then decreasing as weather gets cooler in the fall and winter. Figure 12.1: The percent of crime incidents in 2022 NIBRS by the month of incident. We can also look at the days of the month to see if there is any variation here. Figure 12.2 shows the percent of crimes on each day of the month. There’s not much variation other than a few days. The 29th and 30th day of the month have fewer crimes, and the 31st day has by far the fewest crimes. These findings are reasonable since not all months have that many days so by definition there are fewer 31st (and 29th, and 30th) days of the month for crimes to occur on. The most common day of the month is the 1st which accounts for 3.95% of all incidents. There’s also a small spike on the 15th on the month with 3.39% of incidents occurring on the 15th. No other date is more than 3.35% of incidents. In this data the agencies must report a date, even if they don’t know the exact date; there is no option to put “unknown date”. So when these agencies don’t know when a crime occurred, they put it as the 1st (or less commonly the 15th) of the month. I call this issue the “first-of-the-month error” and it is one I haven’t seen discussed in papers that use daily data from NIBRS. For this reason I’d warn against including the 1st of the month in any analysis where the day of the month is relevant. Figure 12.2: The percent of crimes that occur (the day of the incident, even if the crime wasn’t reported that day) each day of the month for all agencies reporting to NIBRS in 2022. The above graph showed the days of the month where the incident was said to occur. There is also a variable that says if the date included was the incident date or the date the crime was reported to the police. Figure 12.3 replicates Figure 12.2 but now shows only report dates rather than incident date. There’s still a spike for the 1st and 15th but they are very small now and comparable to other days of the month. This provides even more evidence that the incident date spike on the 1st and 15th of the month is just an artifact of agencies putting unknown dates there, rather than a true increase in crime on those days. Figure 12.3: The percent of crimes that are reported (the day of the report, even if not the day of the incident) each day of the month for all agencies reporting to NIBRS in 2022. 12.1.2 Hour of incident An extremely important aspect of crime data is when exactly the crime occurs. If, for example, crime always spikes when the local high school ends their day that would likely indicate that high school students are involved with crime (both as victims or as offenders). In my own research on daylight saving time and crime I only care about the sunset hours, which is when daylight saving time would affect outdoor lighting.84 When crime happens also would affect police behavior as they’d likely increase patrol during times of elevated crime. Luckily, NIBRS data does have the time of each incident, though it’s only at the hour level. Figure 12.4 shows the total number of crimes that occurred in the 2022 NIBRS data for each hour of the day. There are two key trends in this figure. First, past research has found that crime tends to increase during the night (this is especially true during weekends), drop to a daily low in the couple of hours before sunrise, and then slowly increase as the day progresses.85 What we find here is a little different. Crime peaks at night at 5-5:59pm which is far earlier than other estimates. Since this is all crimes it could be biased by large increases of certain crimes at this time, such as people coming home from work and finding their house burgled. As crimes differ in their timing (e.g. burglary happens often during the day, fights are more common at night), you’ll need to merge this segment with the Offense Segment to be able to look at certain types of crimes alone. The second key trend is the large spike at midnight-12:59am and at noon-12:59pm. The midnight spike certainly seems far too large to be real. The midnight hour is more than double that of neighboring hours, and reverses the trend in the hours before it. Crime increases more at night (though not as much here as in other studies of this topic) but not by such a massive amount. The noon hour is about 50% larger than in the neighboring hours, so is a sizable increase though continues the trend of increasing crime during the day and is a far smaller increase than at midnight. It seems unlikely that this spike is real, though potentially some of it could be. For example, if a lot of people take their lunch at noon then there could be an increase of crime (such as pickpocketing and purse snatching) when these people gather at restaurants and malls to eat. So what are these spikes? There is no option to say that the hour is unknown so the police must put something in, and it seems that they put midnight and noon as the default “unknown hour” hour.86 Given this, I recommend that you remove the midnight and noon hour from any analysis you do where the time of day is relevant. Figure 12.4: The percent of crimes that are reported each hour for all agencies reporting to NIBRS in 2022. 12.1.3 Exceptional clearance When we speak of clearances we generally mean that a person was arrested for the crime.87 Cases may also be cleared “through exceptional means” which is also called an “exceptional clearance.” An exceptional clearance means that the police have identified who the offender is (in cases with multiple offenders, they need to identify only one offender), have sufficient evidence and ability (e.g. know where they are) to arrest this offender but are unable to do so for some reason. Basically, if they could arrest them they would but for some reason they can’t. NIBRS data tells us if the case is exceptionally cleared as well as the reason for the exceptional clearance. Exceptional clearances are relatively rare, making up about 5% of cases. Figure 12.5 shows the breakdown of reasons why the case was cleared for these ~5% of cases that are exceptionally cleared. The most common reason, at 47.3% of exceptional clearances, is that the victim refused to cooperate with the police or prosecution. This can include cases where the victim reported their crime to the police and then later decide to stop assisting. The next most common reason, at 45.3% of exceptionally cleared cases, is that the prosecution decides to not prosecute the case. This excludes cases where the prosecution believes that there is not probable cause to make the arrest. Therefore it largely includes cases that the prosecution either doesn’t believe they could win or where the agency has a policy of non-prosecution - this is likely increasingly common in jurisdiction which has “progressive prosecutors” who de facto legalize certain crimes.88 The next most common group is when the offender is a juvenile and the police chose to avoid arresting them due to their age. This occurs in minor offenses such as property crimes and the police do give notice to the juvenile offender’s parents or guardians about the situation. If the offender is in another agency’s jurisdiction (including out of the country) and the agency reporting data is unable to make an arrest, including when the agency who has the offender in their jurisdiction refuses to extradite the offender, the case can be exceptionally cleared. This occurs in 1.6% of exceptional clearances. In these cases we don’t know any information about which jurisdiction the offender is in at the time of the exceptional clearance. Finally, if the offender dies (by any means) before the arrest they can’t be arrested so the case is exceptionally cleared. This makes up about 0.9% of exceptional clearances. Figure 12.5: The distribution of exceptional clearances for all exceptional clearances reported to NIBRS in 2022. 12.1.4 Number of other segments The “Administrative” part of this segment is that it tells us about other segments related to this incident. Here we know how many Offense, Offender, Victim, and Arrestee segments there are for the incident. In effect it says how many crimes were committed, offenders involved (at least the number known to police), victims involved, and people arrested for this particular incident. This can be useful both as a check to make sure you’re not missing anything when looking at the other segments and to quickly subset data, such as to only single-victim or only multiple-offender incidents. 12.1.4.1 Offense Segments This variable indicates how many offense segments there are associated with this incident, with the possible values ranging from one to nine. Each incident can have multiple offenses, so this just says how many of these crimes there were. For example, if a person is raped and robbed then there’d be two offense segments related to that incident. Figure 12.6 shows the number of offense segments - and thus the number of crimes - associated with each incident. The vast majority of incidents only have one offense reported, making up 88.4% of incidents.89 This drops considerably to 10.3% of incidents having two offenses, 1.1% having three, and then under 0.15% of incidents having four through nine offenses. Figure 12.6: The distribution for the number of Offender Segments per incident, for all incidents in NIBRS 2022. 12.1.4.2 Offender Segments The Administrative Segment tells you how many offenders are involved with an incident. This is, of course, an estimate because in some incidents the police don’t know how many people are involved. If, for example, someone was robbed then they can tell the police how many robbers there were. But if someone comes home to find their home burglarized then they don’t know how many burglars there were. If there’s no video evidence (e.g. a home security camera) and neighbors didn’t see anything then the police would not know how many offenders were involved in the incident. In these cases they put in a single offender and in the Offender Segment all of the information about the offender is “unknown.” The remaining number of offenders are still estimates as the police may not know for sure how many offenders were involved, but this is more reliable than when there is only a single offender reported. With that major caveat in mind, Figure 12.7 shows the distribution in how many offenders there were per incident. The vast majority of incidents have only one (or potentially an unknown number) offenders, at 89.8% percent of incidents. Incidents with two offenders make up only 7.9% of incidents while those with three make up 1.6% of incidents. No other number of offenders make up more than 0.5% of incidents. The data does have the exact number of offenders but I’ve top coded it to 10 in the graph for simplicity. There can potentially be a large number of offenders involved in an incident and in the 2022 NIBRS data the incident with the higher number of offenders had 81. However, it is exceedingly rare for there to be even more than a handful of offenders. Figure 12.7: The distribution for the number of Offender Segments per incident, for all incidents in NIBRS 2022. 12.1.4.3 Victim Segments In cases where the offense is a “victimless crime” (or at least one where there’s no specific victim) such as a drug offense, the victim and the offender can be the same individual. For other cases, being a victim in an incident just means that you were the victim of at least one offense committed in the incident. Figure 12.8 shows the distribution in the number of victims per incident. Like the number of offenses and offenders, this is massively skewed to the left with 90.3% of incidents having a single victim. Incidents with two victims make up 7.9% of the data while incidents with three victims are 1.2%. All remaining numbers of victims are less than one third of one percent of the data each. The data does have the exact number of victims but I’ve top coded it to 10 in the graph for simplicity. The incident with the most victims in 2022 had 207 victims. Figure 12.8: The distribution for the number of Victim Segments per incident, for all incidents in NIBRS 2022. 12.1.4.4 Arrestee Segments Unlike the previous segments, there may not always be an arrestee segment since not all crimes lead to an arrest. Figure 12.9 shows the distribution in the number of arrestee segments per incident in the 2022 NIBRS data. Indeed, the vast majority - 72.9% of incidents - didn’t lead to a single arrest. In 24% of incidents a single person was arrested while in 2.5% of incidents two people were arrested. The remaining numbers of people arrested are increasingly small with a little over a third of one percent of incidents having three people arrested and no greater than 0.1% for larger numbers of people arrested. The incident with the most arrests in 2022 led to 81 people arrested. Figure 12.9: The distribution for the number of Arrestee Segments per incident, for all incidents in NIBRS 2022. Of course, to really understand these arrests we’d need to know how many people committed the crime. Having one arrest for an incident with one offender is good, having one arrest when there are multiple offenders means relatively low clearance rates. While we don’t know the true number of offenders (as police may not know how many there actually were), we can use the Offender Segment count as a good estimate. Figure 12.10 shows the percent of people arrested for each number of offenders in the incident. Keep in mind that when there’s one offender reported this can potentially mean the police don’t know how many offenders there are, so it’s a bit unreliable. There is wide variability in the percent of offenders arrested by the number of offenders in an incident. In cases with one offender, there was an arrest made only 25% of the time. When there are two offenders, about 36% of offenders are arrested, on average, and this steadily declines as the number of offenders increase back down to 25.7% with six offenders. This moves a percentage point or two as the number of offenders increases but not by very much. Figure 12.10: The percent of people arrested by the number of offenders in an incident. Another way to look at this is to examine the percent of incidents, by number of offenders, where at least one offender was arrested. Here we’re asking a very different question than in the above figure. Instead of asking, of all offenders who committed a crime what number are arrested, we want to know of all incidents how many led to at least one arrest. This is actually how the UCR defines clearance rates, at least one person arrested (no matter how many offenders there are) clears the entire incident. Figure 12.11 shows this analysis by giving the percent of incidents by the number of offenders where at least one offender was arrested. As before, 25% of incidents with one offender had a person arrested. Now we see a steady decline in the percent of incidents arrested as the number of offenders increase. This figure shows that relatively few incidents ever lead to an arrest of at least one offender, and the chance that an arrest is made decreases as the number of offenders increases. These findings suggest that the larger numbers found in Figure 12.10 are because when at least one offender is arrested in an incident it’s also likely that multiple offenders are arrested. Figure 12.11: The percent of incidents by number of offenders where at least one offender is arrested. It also affects outdoor lighting in the morning, but crime is rare in the morning so would have less of an effect.↩︎ In all of the police ridealongs I’ve been on the police tend to stop patrolling in early morning (e.g. 3-4am) and go back to the station to do paperwork. I think this likely partially explains the findings that crime is lowest around 4-5am.↩︎ To my knowledge these spikes are not discussed in papers that use NIBRS data other than in my own papers.↩︎ While a more expansive definition may include a conviction in a court for that crime (including pleading guilty), NIBRS data only extends to the arrest stage so we never know the judicial outcome of the case.↩︎ Of course this is an empirical question and one that could potentially be examined through NIBRS data. Unfortunately, progressive prosecutors are generally found in large urban cities (e.g. Philadelphia), which also tend to not report NIBRS data. As these agencies start reporting we’ll be able to assess whether progressive prosecutors affect exceptional clearances.↩︎ In reality a person who commits a crime may be arrested or charged with many (often highly related) offenses related to a single criminal incident. So this data does report fewer incidents than you’d likely find in other data sources, such as if you request data from a local police agency or district attorney’s office.↩︎ "],["offenseSegment.html", "Chapter 13 Offense Segment 13.1 Important variables", " Chapter 13 Offense Segment This segment provides information about the offense that occurred, and each incident can have multiple offenses. This data tells you which offense occurred and for a subset of offenses it also provides a more detailed subcategory of offense, allowing a deeper dive into what exactly happened. For example, for animal abuse there are four subcategories of offenses: simple/gross neglect of an animal, intentional abuse or torture, animal sexual abuse (bestiality), and organized fighting of animals such as dog or cock fights. This segment also says what date the crime occurred on, where the crime occurred - in categories such as residence or sidewalk rather than exact coordinates in a city - whether the offender is suspected of using drugs, alcohol, or “computer equipment” (which includes cell phones) during the crime, and which weapon was used. In cases where the weapon was a firearm it says whether that weapon was fully automatic or not. It also provides information on if the crime was a hate crime by including a variable on the bias motivation (if any) of the offender. This is based on evidence that the crime was motivated, at least in part, by the victim’s group (e.g. race, sexuality, religion, etc.). There are 34 possible bias motivations and while hate crimes could potentially be motivated by bias against multiple groups, this data only allows for a single bias motivation. 13.1 Important variables In addition to the variables detailed below this segment has the traditional agency and incident identifiers: the ORI code, the agency state, the year of this data, and the incident number. It also has the date of the incident, which is also included in the Administrative Segment.90 13.1.1 Crime category The first important variable in the Offense Segment is figuring out exactly what offense was committed. This tells you what crime occurred in the incident. There can be multiple crimes in a single incident so this provides info about each crime that occurred. To figure out which offenses belong together, just look at the incident number and the ORI. Within ORI, each incident number is a unique identifier for an incident. Each crime is mutually exclusive and crimes which are elements of another crime are counted only as the crime they are elements of. For example, robberies are basically theft plus assault/intimidation - it is the use of force or threat of force (assault or intimidation) to take property (theft). A case of robbery in this data would only count as robbery, not as robbery and theft and assault/intimidation. If there are these crimes together in an incident that’s because that crime also occurred separately. For example, if someone is robbed and after the robbery is over (i.e. they hand over their belongings) they are then punched repeatedly, that could potentially be classified as a robbery and an assault. Table 13.1 shows each possible crime in the data and how common it was in 2019. It’s sorted by frequency instead of alphabetically so it’s easier to see which crimes are most common. There were about 7.4 million crimes reported to NIBRS in 2019. The most common crime is simple assault - which is an assault that didn’t use a weapon and didn’t result in serious injury - at 12.7% of crimes, or about 944k crimes. If you think this is odd because property crimes are more common than violent crimes, you’d be right. NIBRS data is pretty specific in its crime categories so it splits up certain crimes into a number of different categories. Theft is the most common crime committed in the United States. In NIBRS it’s broken into several different types of theft so you need to combine them together to actually measure theft in its entirety. Of the top 6 most common crimes, theft crimes make up ranks 3, 5, and 6 (all other larceny, theft from motor vehicle, and shoplifting). Though each agency is supposed to report the same crimes - using the exact same definition of the crimes so the data is consistent - that isn’t always true in practice. For example, animal cruelty became a NIBRS crime in 2018 (before that it wasn’t an option so agencies could not report it) and likely most agencies in the US have had at least one animal abuse crime since then. In 2018, however, reporting was concentrated in a small number of states, meaning that not all agencies reported that offense. The concentration in certain states suggests that this low reporting is due to agencies in certain states deciding (or not being able to, such as if having older reporting systems which don’t have animal cruelty as an option) not to report that offense at all. Reporting has increased in 2019 (though still remains highly concentrated), suggesting that over time more agencies begin reporting crimes as they are added. Therefore, I strongly suggest examining your data over time and across geographic areas to see if there are any biases before using it.

This is especially useful for certain crimes where it’s not clear exactly what they’re referring to from the crime category alone. For example, for drug crimes we generally differentiate possession from sale or manufacturing. NIBRS combines everything into “drug/narcotic violations (crimes for drug materials such as syringes are classified as”drug equipment violations”). So we need to use the subtype variable to figure out what type of drug crime it is. Looking at the subtype we can see if the arrest is for distributing/selling\",operating/promoting/assisting”, possessing/concealing\",transporting/transmitting/importing”, or ``using/consuming”. There can be up to three subtypes per offense, so potentially an arrest can be related to something such as both possessing and selling drugs. There are also some unexpected subtypes related to certain offenses. For example, there are a few dozen drug offenses that also have the subtype of “exploiting children”. This subtype is generally for cases where a child is abused, but happens here for drug offenses that don’t have any associated child abuse (or for some of them, doesn’t have any other crime at all) offense. The reason, I believe, for this category is that these offenses occurred in public so could have been viewed by children, and were labeled as exploiting children for that reason. If you’re studying crimes against children, pulling from this variable would likely overcount crimes so - as always - you should make sure that the data you carefully check your data for odd things like this.91 This data is only available for the below subset of crimes, and isn’t always present even for these crimes. Aggravated Assault Animal Cruelty Counterfeiting/Forgery Drug Equipment Violations Drug/Narcotic Violations Fondling (Incident Liberties/Child Molest) Gambling Equipment Violations Intimidation Kidnapping/Abduction Murder/Non-negligent Manslaughter Negligent Manslaughter Pornography/Obscene Material Rape Robbery Sexual Assault With An Object Simple Assault Sodomy Stolen Property Offenses (Receiving, Selling, Etc.)

Table 13.2 shows each possible subtype for animal cruelty and how often they occur. There were about 10,000 cases of animal cruelty reporting to NIBRS in 2019 and over two-thirds are for neglect of the animal. Over a quarter are for torturing or abandoning the poor animal. And the remaining small share of offenses are for sexual abuse of the animal or for forcing them to fight other animals. These subtypes provide a lot more information about the crime that occurred, but still have some uncertainties. We don’t, for example, know the type of animal involved or the severity of the abuse (other than that it was serious enough for police to become involved). Still, this is a large improvement in our understanding of this crime (and others which have subtypes), and a colossal improvement when compared with UCR data. Table 13.3: Table 13.4: The number and percent of crime subtypes for animal abuse. Crime Subcategory # of Offenses % of Offenses Simple/Gross Neglect (Unintentionally, Intentionally, Or Knowingly Failing To Provide Food, Water, Shelter, Veterinary Care, Hoarding, Etc.) 13,144 64.03% Intentional Abuse And Torture (Tormenting, Mutilating, Poisoning, Or Abandonment) 6,835 33.30% Animal Sexual Abuse (Bestiality) 293 1.43% Organized Abuse (Dog Fighting And Cock Fighting) 255 1.24% Total 20,527 100% 13.1.3 Offense completed For each offense, this segment also tells you if the offense was completed or only attempted. Some offenses, such as simple and aggravated assault or homicide, are only labeled as completed. This is because an attempted murder, for example, would be classified as aggravated assault. Since crimes in NIBRS are mutually exclusive, there cannot be both attempted murder and aggravated assault, so only aggravated assault is included. This does limit the data as it is important to know when an aggravated assault is done with the intent to kill the victim and when it’s just to seriously harm the victim (though measuring this would likely be extremely imprecise since it requires knowing the motives of the offender). For other crimes, we do know if each crime was completed or not. In the vast majority of offenses they are completed.92 Table 13.5 shows the percent of each crime category in 2019 NIBRS data that was completed or was only attempted.

Drunk people commit a lot of crime (even though most drunk people never commit crime). Drunk people are also better targets for crime so are chosen by certain offenders who want an easy victim. NIBRS tries to capture this by telling us if the offender is suspected of using drugs (just “drugs” as we don’t know which drug was involved, though we could look in the Property Segment to see what drug [if any] was seized by the police), alcohol, or “computer equipment” which also includes cell phones. Computer equipment is more relevant for certain crimes such as fraud or pornography/obscene materials. For each offense there are three variables about usage of any of these so potentially the offender could have used all three. The data doesn’t get any more specific than if the offender is suspected of using these items. So we don’t know how intoxicated they are or what they used the computer equipment for. Just that they’re suspected of using it. And suspected is key. We don’t know for sure if they used it. If, for example, a victim says that their mugger was drunk, NIBRS will say they’re suspected of using alcohol, even though there’s no definitive proof such as a blood test or breathalyzer. Unlike some past variables like offense subtype where it applies to only a subset of crimes, this variable is available for every crime. Figure 13.1 shows the distribution is suspected usage for all offenses in 2019 NIBRS. This is just from the first suspected use variable for simplicity of the graph, even though there are three variables on this topic. The most common outcome is “Not Applicable” at 87.6% of offenses. Not Applicable actually just means that the offender was not suspected of using drugs, alcohol, or computer equipment. I’m not sure why it’s called that but that’s how NIBRS calls “none of the above”. Since Not Applicable is so common, Figure 13.2 shows the distribution when excluding that option. Figure 13.1: The distribution of drug, alcohol, or computer use for all offenses in 2022 Drug usage is the most common thing offenders are suspected of using. In about 66% of offenses where the offender is suspected of using something (of the drugs, alcohol, or “computer equipment” choices), that something is drugs. Again, we don’t know what type of drug was used, only that it wasn’t alcohol. Alcohol follows at 28% while computer equipment is only 6.1%. Figure 13.2: The distribution of drug, alcohol, or computer use for offenses where there was usage of one of these items. For easier viewing of how this variable is distributed, this figure excludes all offenses where there was no drug, alcohol, or computer use or the variable was NA. 13.1.5 Crime location NIBRS tells us where each crime happened, giving more of a type of location rather than the precise location (e.g. coordinates) where it happened.93 Table 13.6 shows the 46 different location types where each offense could occur, sorted by most common to least common location. The most common place for a crime to occur is in someone’s own home, at 40.4% of crimes. This makes a bit of sense as people spend a lot of time at home and certain crimes, such as burglary and domestic violence, happen a lot of the victim’s own home. Crimes happening on a road or alley make up the second most common location at 16% and parking lot or garage follows at 8.6%. The remaining locations only make up 5% or fewer of offense locations. But keep in mind that some locations may be an overly specific location that fits well into a broader category that you’re interested in. For example, if you care about crimes that happen in stores you’d look at “Bank/Savings and Loan”, “Restaurant”, “Bar/Nightclub” among other locations, which combined have a lot more offenses than any one individually. This is a recurring theme of NIBRS data - you have a lot of data and some of it is so specific that you need to do extra work to aggregate data into units you want.

There can be up to three different weapon types included in an offense. NIBRS data doesn’t provide a weapon used for all offenses, just for the ones that they deem to be violent crimes, and thus could involve a weapon. Please note that this is the weapons used in some capacity during the crime, not necessarily to harm the victim.95 For example, if a gun is involved in a crime, that gun may have been fired and missed the victim, fired and hit the victim, used to beat the victim, or merely brandished. From this data alone we don’t know how it was used. The list of offenses where there is data on weapon usage is below: Aggravated Assault Extortion/Blackmail Fondling (Incident Liberties/Child Molest) Human Trafficking - Commercial Sex Acts Human Trafficking - Involuntary Servitude Justifiable Homicide Kidnapping/Abduction Murder/Nonnegligent Manslaughter Negligent Manslaughter Rape Robbery Sexual Assault With An Object Simple Assault Sodomy Weapon Law Violations Table 13.7 shows the breakdown in the weapons used in the above offenses. There were about 1.6 million offenses reported in NIBRS in 2019 that could have used a weapon. The most common weapon used was only the offender’s body at 57.8% of offenses. The “personal weapons (hands, feet, teeth, etc.) basically means that the offender used or threatened force but wasn’t carrying a weapon. So this includes things like punching, kicking, biting, wrestling, and anything you may see in a boxing or MMA match. Strangulation can be done without any weapons but as strangulation is its own weapon, it is not included in the”personal weapons” category. The next most common group is the offender doesn’t have any weapons, and doesn’t use their body as a weapon, at a little over 10% of offenses, following by the offender using a handgun in 9.4% of offenses. “Other” is the next most common category which just means any weapon not already included in the weapon categories. Knife/cutting instrument makes up 4.5% of offenses and is a rather broad category, composed of anything that could cut or pierce someone’s body. The most likely weapon in this category is a knife, but can extend to rarer items like broken glass or a sword. The remaining weapon groups are rarer than 4% of offenses, but given that NIBRS covers so many crimes these weapons still occur in hundreds or thousands of cases. Table 13.7: The weapon used by an offender in the crime for all offenses reported in 2019. The use means that it was part of the crime though may not have been physically discharged. For example, pointing a gun at someone even without firing the gun is still using it. Weapon Used # of Offenses % of Offenses Personal Weapons (Hands, Feet, Teeth, Etc.) 1,606,675 53.47% Handgun 338,577 11.27% None 335,457 11.17% Other 215,383 7.17% Firearm (Type Not Stated) 148,388 4.94% Knife/Cutting Instrument (Ice Pick, Screwdriver, Ax, Etc.) 124,928 4.16% Unknown 87,932 2.93% Blunt Object (Club, Hammer, Etc.) 61,767 2.06% Motor Vehicle 29,078 0.97% Rifle 17,093 0.57% Other Firearm 12,213 0.41% Asphyxiation (By Drowning, Strangulation, Suffocation, Gas, Etc.) 11,853 0.39% Shotgun 8,857 0.29% Drugs/Narcotics/Sleeping Pills 2,362 0.08% Explosives 1,832 0.06% Fire/Incendiary Device 1,476 0.05% Poison (Include Gas) 664 0.02% 16 1 0.00% 17 1 0.00% Total 3,004,537 100% 13.1.7 Automatic weapons When the weapon involved was a firearm there is a variable which indicates that the firearm was fully automatic. To be clear, this means that when you pull the trigger once the gun will fire multiple bullets. Semi-automatic firearms are not automatic firearms. Of course, saying a gun is fully automatic requires either the policing seizing the gun or the gun being fired (and for witnesses to accurately determine that it is fully automatic). Since most crimes are never solved (and even those that lead to an arrest may not lead to the gun being seized - though some guns are seized even without an arrest, such as if the gun is left at the crime scene) and most gun crimes don’t actually involve the gun being fired, this variable is likely very imprecise. Still, Figure 13.3 shows the percent of firearms used in offenses in 2019 that are reported to be fully automatic. Even though there can be up to three weapons used in an offense, this figure only looks at the first weapon. The most common guns to be automatic are rifles and handguns, both with about 4.5% of all uses being of an automatic weapon. The remaining categories are all under 3% of uses. Figure 13.3: The percent of firearms used that were fully automatic, for all offenses in 2022. 13.1.8 Burglary info For burglary offenses specifically there are two variables that provide a little more information on the offense. The first variable is the number of “premises” that the burglar entered. This is only available when the location for the offense is either hotel/motel or a rental storage facility. So the “premise” can really be thought of as a room in the building, not that they break into multiple hotels. Figure 13.4 shows the breakdown in the number of premises entered during a burglary incident. The graph is capped at 10 or more but in 2019 the highest number was 99 buildings entered, which is the maximum value the police can enter, so in reality it may have been higher. The vast majority of hotel/motel and storage facility burglaries only have one room entered, with 85% of these burglaries only being on a single room. This declines enormously to 4.7% burglarizing two rooms and then nearly halves to 2.5% burglarizing three rooms. This trend continues as the number of rooms increase. Figure 13.4: The distribution in the number of premises entered during burglaries. This info is only available for burglaries in a hotel/motel or rental storage facilities. The second variable, and one where there is data from every burglary reported regardless of location, says whether the burglar entered the building forcibly or not. A burglary without force is one when the burglary only enters through unlocked doors or windows. The only means that if they entered through an unlocked door or window and then forced open another door or window, the entire burglary is classified as forcible entry. Forcible entry is any when the burglar has to access a locked door or window through any means of entering. This is very broad and includes actions ranging from breaking the window - which people generally think of when it comes to forcible entry - to less obvious uses of force like picking the lock or even using a passcard (e.g. a hotel room card) to unlock the door. The FBI also includes when a burglar enters a building legally and then stays past their allowed time (e.g. walk into a store and hide somewhere until past closing time). Figure 13.5 shows the breakdown in burglaries by type of entry. The majority of burglaries, 57.6%, use force at some point in the burglary. 42.4% don’t use force at all. There’s no option for “unknown” if force was used so my guess is that when in doubt - that is, when there’s no evidence of force - the police report that no force is used. Figure 13.5: The percent of burglaries reported in 2022 where the burglary entered the structure forcibly or non-forcibly. 13.1.9 Hate crime indicator (bias motivation) For each offense NIBRS indicates whether it had a bias motivation, which is NIBRS way of saying if it was a hate crime or not. For the police to classify an incident as a hate crime, and to assign a particular bias motivation, the police must have some evidence that the crime was motivated by hate. The victim saying that the crime is a hate crime alone is not sufficient - though if large portions of the victim’s community believe that the crime is a hate crime, this is a factor in the police’s assessment. The evidence required is not major, it includes things as explicit as racial slurs said during an incident and less obvious factors like if the crime happened while the victim was celebrating their community (e.g. attending a holiday event) or the crime occurring on an important holiday for that community (e.g. Martin Luther King Day, religious holidays). The FBI also encourages police to consider the totality of the evidence even if none alone strongly suggests that the crime was a hate crime in making their determination about whether the incident was a hate crime or not. This also means that many (likely most) hate crimes will not be recorded as hate crimes since there is no evidence that the crime is motivated by hate. For example, if a man targeted Asian people for crimes because they are Asian, that would in reality be a hate crime. However, if the offender does not say anything anti-Asian to the victim, which is the mostly likely thing to indicate that this is a hate crime, the crime would not likely be recorded as a hate crime. At the time of this writing (Spring 2021), there are numerous media reports discussing an increase in anti-Asian hate crimes as a result of racism relating to the pandemic. This data would likely undercount both anti-Asian behavior and anti-Asian hate crimes. First, if someone walked to an Asian person and called them an anti-Asian slur, that is clearly a hateful act and would be classified as a hate crime under some organization’s collections methods. However, as hateful as this incident is, this alone would not be classified as a hate crime in this dataset as a slur is not a crime. If accompanied by other criminal behavior, or if it continues to the point where it can be considered intimidation, it would then be classified as a hate crime. Second, crimes against Asian victims that are in fact hate crimes, but have no evidence that they are hate crimes would not be classified as hate crimes in this data. Bias motivation is based on the offender’s perceptions of the victim so even if they are incorrect in who their victim is, if they intended to target someone for their perceived group membership, that is still a hate crime. For example, if a person assaults a man because they think he is gay, that is a hate crime because the assault was motivated by hate towards gay people. Whether the victim is actually gay or not is not relevant - the offender perceived him to be gay so it is an anti-gay hate crime. To make this even more complicated, the offender must have committed the crime because they are motivated, at least to some degree, by their bias against the victim. Being biased against the victim but targeting them for some other reason means that the crime is not a hate crime. Table 13.8 shows the percent of all offenses in 2019 that were classified with or without a bias motivation. Nearly all offenses - 99.14% - are without a bias motivation meaning that they are not considered hate crimes. This still leaves a 63,876 offenses classified as hate crimes. Table 13.8: The number and percent of offenders that had a bias motivation or not for all offenses reported in 2022. Bias Motivation # of Offenses % of Offenses No Bias Motivation 12,610,154 99.19% Bias Motivation 102,659 0.81% Total 12,712,813 100% Table 13.9 shows the breakdown in the bias motivation of hate crimes, for all incidents where the crime is considered a hate crime. The most common bias motivation is anti-Black, which accounts for 29% of all hate crimes in the data. This is followed by anti-White at 12.7% and “anti-male homosexual (gay)” at almost 8% of crimes. The only other biases that make up more than 5% of hate crimes are anti-Hispanic and anti-Jewish.96 Some of these groups are also subsets of larger groups. For example, anti-Muslim, anti-Arab, and anti-Sikh (while Sikhs are not Muslim or Arabic, some Sikhs have been targeted by people who incorrectly believe that they are) are probably all the same bias motivation. Likewise, attacks on LGBT people are in multiple categories, which allows for a more detailed understanding of these hate crimes but requires aggregation to look at them as a group. While this aggregation is easy enough to do, accidentally missing any of the subcategories could vastly undercount offenses against the larger category. Table 13.9: The bias motivation (i.e. if hate crime or not and what type of hate crime) for all offenses reported in 2022 that were classified as hate crimes. For easier viewing of how hate crimes are broken down, this excludes all offenses where there was no bias motivation.

For example, if an incident happened at 11:50pm and it had multiple crimes involved, some of them may occur the follow day, such as at 12:01am.↩︎ Whether children viewing a crime, even a drug crime, would count as a crime against children would, of course, depend on your definition.↩︎ This is likely in part due to completed crimes being easier to detect than attempted crimes. For example, if someone breaks into your house you’ll likely discover that and alert the police. If someone tries to break in but fails (even something as minor as trying your front door to see if it is locked and then leaving because it could be considered attempted burglary) there is much less evidence so it probably doesn’t come to the police’s attention as much.↩︎ My own research looks a lot at how the built environment affects behavior. For example, I have a few papers looking at how outdoor lighting affects crime. Outdoor lighting largely only effects outdoor crimes (since there are generally already lights indoors) so this variable in NIBRS has been crucial for my research.↩︎ The 2021 NYC mayor election, which as of this writing has not been completed yet, seems to hinge on an increase of gun violence in the city.↩︎ The Victim Segment does have data on victim injuries though it doesn’t say which weapon caused the injuries↩︎ Looking at the raw percents is a rather naive measure as it assumes that all groups have equal risk of hate crimes. Certain groups, such as Jews and transgender people, make up a relatively small share of the percent of hate crimes but when considering their percent of the overall population (itself only a slightly better measure as even total population doesn’t account for true opportunity to be victimized) are victimized at much higher rates than many other groups.↩︎ "],["offender-segment-1.html", "Chapter 14 Offender Segment 14.1 Important variables", " Chapter 14 Offender Segment As might be expected, the Offender Segment provides information about who the offender (or offenders) is (are) for each incident, though this is limited to only demographic variables. So we know the age, sex, and race of each offender but nothing else. This means that important variables such as criminal history, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and motive are missing. In the Victim Segment we learn about the relationship between the victim and offender, and in the Offense Segment we learn which weapon (if any) the offender used. So there is some other data on the offender in other segments but it’s quite limited. This data has one row per offender so incidents with multiple offenders have multiple rows. In cases where there is no information about the offender there will be a single row where all of the offender variables will be “unknown.” In these cases having a single row for the offender is merely a placeholder and doesn’t necessarily mean that there was only one offender for that incident. However, there’s no indicator for when this is a placeholder and when there was actually one offender but whose demographic info is unknown. 14.1 Important variables The Offender Segment is the sparsest of the available segments, and provides only three new variables that are about the offender’s demographics. It also includes the standard set of variables: the agency ORI, the incident number, the state the agency is in, and the incident date (though we’d need to check the Administrative Segment to see if this is actually the incident date or the report date). 14.1.1 Demographics There are three demographics variables included in this data: the offenders’ age, sex, and race. Please note that what we have here are not unique offenders as someone may be involved in multiple crimes. There’s no offender ID variable that is consistent across incidents so we can’t tell when an offender is involved with different incidents (except in cases where they are arrested, see Chapter 16 for more).So be cautious when trying to compare this with some base rate such as percent of people of each age/sex/race in a population. 14.1.1.1 Age The age variable is the suspected age of the offender. This is presented to us as whole years though agencies can input an age range if they don’t know the exact age (e.g. age 20-29) and the FBI will convert that to an exact number by averaging it for us. So if the police say the offender is aged 20-29 (since they don’t know for sure), we only see that the offender is 24 years old since the FBI (for some reason) rounds down. This value is top-coded to 99 years old with everyone 99 years or older being set as “over 98 years old.” Figure 14.1 shows the distribution of offender ages for all known offenders in the 2019 NIBRS data. About 14% of offenders have an unknown age and are excluded from the figure. This figure shows the percent of offenders at each age that make up known offenders in the data (known here meaning that we have info on their age, not that their identity is known). If you’re familiar with research on the age-crime curve, which says that crimes peak in the late teens and then rapidly decrease, this essentially replicates those findings. There are some differences between this figure and past age-crime research as crime peaks later here, in the mid-20s (the most common age is 25), but the general trend of crime being largely a “young person” phenomenon holds consistent. This also depends on exactly which crime occurs as different crimes have different age-crime trends, so you’ll need to merge this segment with the Offense Segment to be able to subset by crime committed. Figure 14.1: The age of all offenders reported in the 2022 NIBRS data. Approximately 44 percent of offenders have an unknown age are not shown in the figure. The spike you see at the very end of the data is due to the data maxing out possible individual ages at 98, so anyone older is grouped together. There’s also a spike at age 1 - and other offenders at very young ages - which is the youngest possible age. Surely very young children aren’t going around attacking people, so is this a data error? Yes. But it could actually be partially real as there are very rare cases where children harm or kill someone while playing with a gun and are included in the data. These aren’t crimes as we conventionally think of them - and the “offenders” won’t be criminally charged - but are still included in the data. However, the bulk of this, especially for age 1, is likely just a data error or the police entering age 1 instead of saying that the age is unknown (which they have the option of doing). Another indicator of guesses about age is that three of the five most common ages are 25, 30, and 20 years old. People tend to like multiples of five when making estimates, so these indicate that someone (the victim or the officer) probably didn’t know the exact age and so guessed the age. 14.1.1.2 Sex The second offender demographic variable available is the offender’s sex with male and female being the only available sexes. There is no option for transgender or any other identify. Other than arrestees, where police could (though we don’t know if they do) use their identification (e.g. driver’s license) to determine their sex, this is the perceived sex of the offender. Figure 14.2 shows the distribution of offenders by sex. The most common sex is male, which is consistent with the literature on who commits crime. About 45% of all offenders were male. Female offenders make up nearly 19% of offenders. Over a third - 35.9% - of offenders have an unknown sex. Considering that when nothing is known about offenders (including even how many offenders there are) this data includes a single row with “unknown” for all demographic variables, this is actually an undercount of offenders who have unknown sex. Figure 14.2: The sex of all offenders reported in the 2022 NIBRS data. 14.1.1.3 Race The final variable available is the race of the offender. The only possible races are White, Black, American Indian/Alaskan Native, Asian, and Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander. These categories are mutually exclusive so people cannot be labeled as mixed race, they must be put into one of the categories. Other than offenders who were arrested, and thus police can clearly see them and potentially ask them what race they are, this variable is likely a rough estimate of a person’s race. Figure 14.3 shows the breakdown in offender races for every offender in the 2019 data. The most common offender race is Unknown, with about 38.5% of offenders not having a known race. This 38.5% of actually an undercount as in cases where the agency doesn’t know anything about the offenders they’ll put down a single offender with “unknown” for every demographics variable. So there could potentially be multiple offenders represented when there is a row with an unknown offender race. This is also dependent on the type of crimes committed and when they are committed. For example, a daytime robbery would likely have a known offender race as the victim can clearly see (complexities about identifying people’s race aside) the race of the robber. A daytime burglary where no one is home would likely have an unknown offender race and there’d be no witnesses.97 Likewise, a robbery at night could have an unknown offender race because the darkness makes it harder to identify people. The next most common offender race is White at 38.7% followed by Black at 22.1%. The remaining races make up only a little over 1.5% of offenders, with American Indian/Alaskan Native at 0.77%, Asian at 0.63%, and Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander at 0.24%. Figure 14.3: The race of all offenders reported in the 2022 NIBRS data. When NIBRS 2020 data comes out it’ll be interesting to see how people staying at home due to covid affects the amount of unknown offender info.↩︎ "],["victim-segment-1.html", "Chapter 15 Victim Segment 15.1 Important variables", " Chapter 15 Victim Segment The Victim Segment provides data at the victim-level and includes information about who the victim is and their relationship to offenders. This data tells us what “type” of victim it is with the type meaning if they are a police officer, a civilian (“Individual” and basically any person who isn’t a police officer), a business, the government, etc. It also includes the standard demographics variables in other segments - age, race, sex, ethnicity - as well as whether the victim is a resident (i.e. do they live there?) of the jurisdiction where they were victimized. We also learn from this data what types of injuries (if any) the victim suffered as a result of the crime. This is limited to physical injuries - excluding important outcomes such as mental duress or PTSD - but allows for a much better measure of harm from crime than simply assuming (or using past studies that tend to be old and only look at the cost of crime) what harm comes from certain offenses. There are seven possible injury types (including no injury at all) and victims can report up to five of these injuries so we have a fairly detailed measure of victim injury. One highly interesting variable in this segment is the relationship between the victim and the offender (for up to 10 offenders). This includes, for example, if the victim was the offender’s wife, their child, employee, or if the stranger was unknown to them, with 27 total possible relationship categories. You can use this to determine which incidents were crimes by strangers, identify domestic violence, or simply learn who tends to commit crimes against certain types of victims. This variable is only available when the victim is a police officer or an “individual.” This makes some sense though there could actually be cases where non-human victims (e.g. businesses, religious organizations) do have a relationship with the offender such as an employee stealing from a store. Related to the victim-offender relationship, this segment provides a bit of information about the motive for the crime. For aggravated assaults and homicides, there is a variable with the “circumstance” of the offense which is essentially the reason why the crime occurred. For example, possible circumstances are arguments between people, hunting accidents, child playing with weapon, and domestic violence. 15.1 Important variables In addition to the variables detailed below this segment has the traditional agency and incident identifiers: the ORI code, the agency state, the year of this data, and the incident number. It also has a “victim sequence number” which is a number identifying the victim in an incident since some incidents have multiple victims. 15.1.1 Crime category The first variable we’ll look at is the crime the victim experienced. This is a bit different than the offenses in the Offense Segment as not all victims in an incident are victimized by all of the crimes involved. For example, if a couple is assaulted and the woman is raped, the woman would experience rape and assault while the man only experiences assault. NIBRS allows for up to 10 offenses per victim and these are supposed to be ranked in order of seriousness. So the first variable has the most serious offense, the second has the second most serious offense, and so on. This is true is most cases but some have more minor crimes presented before more serious crimes. This seems to just be a data entry issue and nothing systematic but you should still check all offense variables if you’re interested in finding the most serious crime per victim. There are 52 possible offenses included in this segment and Table 15.1 shows how frequent each offense is. Though there are 10 possible offenses per victim, this table only looks at the first offense. The most common offense is simple assault, affecting 12.7% of victims or 944k people. This is followed by damage, vandalism, or destruction of property for 11% of victims. About 9.6% of victims experience drugs/narcotic violations, and these victims are likely also the offenders in the case (all incidents must have a victim recorded so in drug crimes the victims are also the offenders in most cases). Theft crimes, broken into some subcategories like “all other larceny” and “theft from motor vehicle” make up the three of the top six crimes (ranks 3, 5, and 6) people are victimized by. And the only remaining crime that accounts for 5% or more of offenses is burglary at 6.4%. Table 15.1: The number and percent of crimes committed against each victim. For victims with multiple crimes committed against them, this shows the most serious crime.

This isn’t entirely true. Some victims may be organizations, businesses, or other inanimate objects.98 NIBRS has nine different types of victims (including “unknown” type and “other” type) in the data and it tells us which type each victim is. Figure 15.1 shows each of the victim types and how commonly they appear in the data. Two key ones are “individual” at 69.4% of victims and law enforcement officer at 0.5% of victims. Law enforcement officers who are victimized are only classified as law enforcement officers when they are the victims of murder, aggravated or simple assault, or intimidation. Otherwise they’re labeled as “individual” victims. So an individual is a person who is either not a law enforcement officer or who is an officer but isn’t victimized by one of the approved crimes. These two are special types of victims as all other variables in this segment apply only to them. This is because non-humans cannot have demographic information, injuries (injury to property would be detailed in the Property Segment in Chapter 17), or relationships.99 The next most common type is business at 15.6% of victims, “society/public” at 12.9% of victims, and the government in 1% of victims. When the victim is society/public that means that the offense is a “victimless crime” or one where there is no specific victim. This includes drug offenses, animal cruelty (animals cannon be victims in this data), prostitution-related offenses (purchasing, promoting, and being a prostitute), pornography/obscene materials, and weapon offenses. The remaining categories - financial institution, other victim type, unknown victim type, and religion organization - are each under 0.25% of victims. Figure 15.1: The distribution of the type of victim. Victim types are mutually exclusive. 15.1.3 Injury An important variable that’s completely missing in UCR data is how injured the victim was. NIBRS has eight different categories of victim injuries ranging from no injury to serious injuries such as “possible internal injury” or “apparent broken bones”. NIBRS includes five variables for victim injuries so up to five of the seven injury types (if there is no injury, that will take up the first variable and no others will be recorded) per victim. These injuries should be thought of as suspected injuries based on observations by the officer or what the victim says. These do not need to be confirmed by a doctor. Therefore there is some imprecision on the exact victim injury. For example, “possible internal injury” means only the possibility, even if the victim doesn’t turn out to have internal injuries. However, it is still a useful measure of victim injury and is highly necessary given that UCR data doesn’t provide any indication about injury. As academics continue to argue about which crimes are serious, this variable can provide information as to exactly how injured victims are from the crime.100 Not all crimes have this information. The FBI only includes this info for what they consider violent crimes which are listed below (since victims may have up to 10 offenses recorded, only one offense has to be among the below list for injury to be recorded). Aggravated assault Extortion/blackmail Fondling Human trafficking - commercial sex acts Human trafficking - involuntary servitude Kidnapping/abduction Rape Robbery Sexual assault with an object Simple assault Sodomy Even though there are up to five victim injuries recorded, for the below graphs I’m just looking at the first variable. Injuries are sorted by seriousness with the first recorded injury more serious than the second, and so on, so this will look at the most serious injuries victims received. As with most variables in this data, only “individual” and law enforcement officer victims have this info. Figure 15.2 shows the eight injury categories and how common they are for all victims with this information reported. The most common type is “none” at 52.6% of injuries which means the victim didn’t suffer any injuries at all. This is followed by 42.0% of victims suffering “apparent minor injuries.” The six serious injuries are far lesson common and given that nearly a third of victims suffer none or minor injuries are hard to see on the graph. To make it easier to see, Figure 15.3 shows the breakdown in victim injury excluding those who didn’t suffer an injury or those who suffered a minor injury. Figure 15.2: The distribution of the injury sustained by the victim. Only individual and law enforcement officer victims have this variable available. For the group who suffered one of the six more serious injury types, 32.1% suffered an “other major injury” which is a serious injury other than one of the other categories. This is followed by 25.8% having a serious laceration (a laceration is a cut), 21.6% having a possible internal injury, and 12.5% having an apparent broken bone. About 6.5% of these victims became unconscious at some point in the incident, and 1.5% lost at least one tooth. Trends for law enforcement officer victims (not shown) are nearly identical for those with an injury but have more victims reporting no injury at all relative to non-law enforcement officer victims. Figure 15.3: The distribution of the injury sustained by the victim for those who had an injury other than ‘none’ or ‘apparent minor injuries’. 15.1.4 Relationship to offender One interesting variable in this segment is that we know the relationship between the victim and the offender. There are 27 possible relationship types (including “unknown” relationship) which can be broken into three broad categories: legal family members, people known to the victim but who aren’t family, and people not known to the victim. These relationship categories are mutually exclusive. If, for example, there were two possible relationship categories that apply, such as the victim was both the friend and the neighbor of the offender, only a single category would be reported. Table 15.2 shows each of the relationship categories and how frequently they occur. The most common relationship category, accounting for 19.8% of relationships was that the relationship was unknown. This is followed by 14.4% of victims being the boyfriend or girlfriend (we can find out which by looking at their sex) of the offender. Then victims were the acquaintance of or a stranger to the offender at 13% and 12.8%, respectively. The only other categories that account for over 5% of victims are the victim being “otherwise known” to the offender at 9.5% and being the spouse of the offender at 5.4%. One relationship to note is that when the victim “was child” that means they were the offender’s biological or adopted child. This doesn’t mean that they are actually a child (&lt;18 years old). If you’re familiar with the FBI’s Supplementary Homicide Report data, this variable - and the two following variables - is also in that dataset. Table 15.2: The distribution of the relationship between the victim and the offender. Only individual and law enforcement officer victims have this variable available. Crime Category # of Victims % of Victims Relationship Unknown 1,117,979 24.31% Victim Was Stranger 669,425 14.56% Victim Was Boyfriend/Girlfriend 538,762 11.72% Victim Was Acquaintance 505,720 11.00% Victim Was Otherwise Known 384,883 8.37% Victim Was Spouse 209,028 4.55% Victim Was Ex-Relationship (Ex-Boyfriend/Ex-Girlfriend) 172,218 3.75% Victim Was Parent 163,978 3.57% Victim Was Child 128,085 2.79% Victim Was Other Family Member 113,811 2.48% Victim Was Sibling 102,790 2.24% Victim Was Friend 100,191 2.18% Victim Was Offender 93,715 2.04% Victim Was Neighbor 86,725 1.89% Victim Was Ex-Spouse 52,407 1.14% Victim Was Common-Law Spouse 25,507 0.55% Victim Was In-Law 19,763 0.43% Victim Was Step-Child 19,401 0.42% Victim Was Grandparent 19,054 0.41% Victim Was Step-Parent 15,982 0.35% Victim Was Employee 14,920 0.32% Victim Was Child of Boyfriend/Girlfriend 14,423 0.31% Victim Was Employer 13,567 0.30% Victim Was Grandchild 8,776 0.19% Victim Was Step-Sibling 4,616 0.10% Victim Was Babysittee (The Baby) 2,399 0.05% Total 4,598,125 100% We also know the relationship between victim and offender when the victim is a law enforcement officer. As shown in Table 15.3, most of the time the officer didn’t know the offender, with 58.9% of victimizations being this relationship type. This is followed by 18.7% where the officer knew the offender, including if they were familiar with the person by arresting or stopping them previously. In about 18.5% we don’t know the relationship as it is unknown and in 3.2% the officer and the offender were acquaintances. There are also a number of unlikely (and some impossible) relationships like the three in which the officer was the offender’s child and the one in which the officer was a baby who was abused by their babysitter. These seem to be clear indications that there are some data errors with this variable. Table 15.3: The distribution of the relationship between the victim and the offender for law enforcement officer victims.

There can be up to two motives, what NIBRS calls circumstances, for each of these offenses. Table 15.4 shows all of the possible circumstances in the data, and shows the frequency only of the first circumstance. The most common circumstance is that there was an argument, and this accounts for 42.7% of these victims. The next most common is 24% which had unknown circumstances followed by 18.7% with “other” circumstances. The next most common group is “lovers’ quarrel” which the FBI relabeled as “domestic violence” beginning in 2019. This group accounts for 9.4% of victims. Assault on law enforcement officers is the next most common group at 2.8% of victims. All other groups are less common than 2% of victims. Table 15.4: The distribution of circumstances for aggravated assault and homicides. Circumstance Crime Category # of Victims % of Victims Argument Aggravated Assault/Murder 263,394 37.82% Unknown Circumstances Aggravated Assault/Murder 176,578 25.35% Other Circumstances Aggravated Assault/Murder 135,511 19.46% Domestic Violence Aggravated Assault/Murder 83,118 11.93% Assault On Law Enforcement Officer(S) Aggravated Assault/Murder 19,495 2.80% Other Felony Involved Aggravated Assault/Murder 9,213 1.32% Gangland Aggravated Assault/Murder 2,938 0.42% Drug Dealing Aggravated Assault/Murder 2,326 0.33% Juvenile Gang Aggravated Assault/Murder 1,509 0.22% Other Negligent Killings Negligent Manslaughter 1,433 0.21% Criminal Killed By Private Citizen Justifiable Homicide 409 0.06% Other Negligent Weapon Handling Negligent Manslaughter 270 0.04% Criminal Killed By Police Officer Justifiable Homicide 225 0.03% Mercy Killing Aggravated Assault/Murder 47 0.01% Child Playing With Weapon Negligent Manslaughter 40 0.01% Gun-Cleaning Accident Negligent Manslaughter 4 0.00% Hunting Accident Negligent Manslaughter 3 0.00% Total Aggravated Assault/Murder 696,513 100% 15.1.6 Justifiable homicide circumstance We know a little bit more in cases of justifiable homicides. Here, we know the circumstances behind the homicide. Figure 15.4 shows the circumstance breakdown for all 308 justifiable homicides reported in 2019. The most common reason, at 34.4% of justifiable homicides is because the offender attacked a civilian. In 21% of justifiable homicides the offender attacked a police officer and was killed by the same officer. In 6.5% the offender attacked a police officer and was killed by a different officer. This is followed by 28% being killed during the commission of a crime. In 4.9% of justifiable homicides, the circumstance is unknown. 3.6% had the offender killed while fleeing from a crime and 1% were killed while resisting arrest. Figure 15.4: The distribution of circumstances for justifiable homicides (N = 308 in 2022 for all agencies reporting). 15.1.7 Demographics As only people have demographics, these variables only apply when the victim is an individual or a law enforcement officer. The demographics here cover victim age, race, sex, ethnicity, and whether they live in the jurisdiction of the agency where they were victimized. For the following graphs I’ll be using all victims, not separating by if they are an “individual” or a law enforcement officer. 15.1.7.1 Residence status This segment tells us if the victim is a resident of the jurisdiction they were victimized in. This basically means whether or not they live in the city where the crime happened. It has nothing to do with residence status or citizenship status in the United States. The FBI defines residence as their legal permanent address though it’s unclear how that is handled for people without this info (though this is far less likely to be a problem here than for arrestees which also report this variable) and when people live permanently in a different spot than their legal address. This variable is useful when trying to figure out if victims are those who live in the area or live outside of it, such as tourists or workers who live nearby. Since crime rates are usually crimes per residents in the jurisdiction, this can be used to determine how reliable that denominator is. If many victims are residents then it makes much more sense than if few are. Table 15.5 shows the residence status for all individual or law enforcement officer victims. The vast majority, 67%, of victims are residents of the jurisdiction where they were victimized while 12.5% were not residents. 20.4% of victims have an unknown resident status. Figure 15.5: The distribution of residence status for all victims reported to NIBRS in 2022. Residence status is residence in the police agency’s jurisdiction (e.g. do you live in the city you were victimized in?). It is unrelated to citizenship or immigration status. One proposed measure to improve policing is to require police officers (or at least newly hired officers) live in the city where they work. The idea here is that people will do a better job if it affects the place they consider home.101 Luckily for us, NIBRS includes law enforcement officers in their measure of whether the victim lives in the jurisdiction where they were victimized. Since law enforcement officers are only recorded to be victims when on the job, this is one measure of where officers live. Figure 15.6 shows the residence status for law enforcement officer victims. Most law enforcement officer victims reside in their jurisdiction with being 53.2% residents and 13.3% being non-residents. However, there is a lot of uncertainty as 33.5% have an unknown residence status. Figure 15.6: The distribution of residence status for all Law Enforcement Officer victims. 15.1.7.2 Age This variable is the age of the victim when the crime occurred, regardless of when they reported the crime. Age is given as how many years old the victim is, with a few exceptions. Victims older than 98 are grouped together as “over 98 years old” while victims younger than 1 years old are broken down into “under 24 hours (neonate)”, “1-6 days old”, and “7-364 days old”. About 1.4% of victim ages are unknown. Figure 15.7 shows the percent of victims at each age available. This is pretty similar to the age of offenders shown in Figure 14.1 with a peak in the mid to late 20s with a long decline after. The most common victim age is 27 followed by 28, 29, and 30. Relative to offender ages, there are far more young victims. About 2.8% of victims, or 145k victims, in 2019 were aged 14 or younger. However, remember that this is for all victims of any crime so age trends may differ by which crime you’re looking at. Figure 15.7: The age of all victims reported in the 2022 NIBRS data. 15.1.7.3 Sex As with the Offender and the Arrestee Segments, we know the sex of the victim. The only choices are female, male, and unknown sex. There is no option for transgender or any other identify. Since the victim can tell the police their sex, and the police can see them clearly in most cases (though this may not be true if the victim reports a crime over the phone by calling 911 but then doesn’t stay to be interviewed) so is more reliable than in the Offender Segment which may include guesses about the offender. The most common victim sex is female at 50.8% of victims, followed closely by male at 48.4%. Only about 0.8% of victims have an unknown sex. It’s interesting that female victims are so common since most criminology research finds that male victims are so common. I think this is likely due to criminologists primarily focusing on murder and index violent crimes as their measure of crime, which ignores many other crimes.102 Figure 15.8: The sex of all victims reported in the 2022 NIBRS data. 15.1.7.4 Race For each victim we also know their race. The only possible races are White, Black, American Indian/Alaskan Native, Asian, and Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander. These categories are mutually exclusive so people cannot be labeled as mixed race, they must be put into one of the categories. Since the police generally can talk to the victim it is possible that they ask the victim what race they are rather than just guess based on appearance. However, this may differ based on agency and the officer taking the report so may be inconsistent. Figure 15.9 shows the breakdown in victims by race. Most victims are White at about 67.8% of victims, followed by Black victims at 23.4%. 5.6% have an unknown race. The remaining victims are made up of 1.9% Asian victims, 0,7% American Indian/Alaskan Native victims, and 0.5% Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander. Figure 15.9: The race of all victims reported in the 2022 NIBRS data. 15.1.7.5 Ethnicity The final demographics variable for victims is their ethnicity, which is whether they are Hispanic or not. Ethnicity is an optional variable so agencies don’t have to ever report it. This means that some agencies never report it, some always report it, and some report it only sometimes. The “sometimes report” agencies are probably the most dangerous to use since it’s unclear when they report it, which could lead to biased data (such as only reporting it when the suspect is confirmed Hispanic or not, which may not be how other agencies define it). There’s also the question of reliability of the ethnicity data. Someone being Hispanic or not is likely just what the arrestees calls themselves or what the arresting officer perceives them to be. Both are important ways of measuring ethnicity but get at different things. Perception is more important for studies of bias, self-identification for differences among groups of people such as arrest rates by ethnicity. And the subjectivity of who is classified as Hispanic means that this measurement may differ by agency and by officer, making it imprecise. Figure 15.10 shows the breakdown in arrests by victim ethnicity for all victims in 2019. Most arrestees - 62.2% - are not Hispanic. Only 10.5% are reported to be Hispanic but a much higher percent of arrestees - 27.2% - have an unknown ethnicity. Given that over a quarter of victims don’t have ethnicity data, if you’d like to use this variable I recommend that you carefully examine the data to ensure that the agencies you’re looking at (if you don’t use all agencies in the data) have a much higher reporting rate. Figure 15.10: The ethnicity of all victims reported in the 2022 NIBRS data. Even though “corporations are people”.↩︎ Businesses may have some form of demographic information if you think about demographics of the owners or managers. However, that information is not available. If the business was targeted due to the owner’s demographics then that may be considered a hate crime and be reported in the Offense Segment.↩︎ criminologists are currently saying that “crime” is down during covid since “crime” is defined as index crimes which are mostly thefts. So clearly victim injury is not a topic taken seriously by most criminologists.↩︎ Since crime is generally concentrated in a small number of impoverished parts of town, and police likely won’t live in these parts, this probably won’t be very effective.↩︎ Murder and other violent crimes are mainly men hurting/killing other men, except in domestic violence which is primarily men hurting/killing women.↩︎ "],["arrestee.html", "Chapter 16 Arrestee, Group B Arrestee, and Window Arrestee Segment 16.1 Important variables", " Chapter 16 Arrestee, Group B Arrestee, and Window Arrestee Segment The Arrestee Segment has information on the person arrested in an incident and has a number of variables that look at same as in previous segments but with subtle differences. This segment covers the arrestee’s age, sex, and race, ethnicity, and residency status (of the city, not as a United States citizen). Age, sex, and race are also in the Offender Segment but can differ as not all offenders are arrested. It also says the crime the arrestee was arrested for (which in some cases is different than the crime committed in the offense since an arrest can clear multiple incidents), the weapon carried during the arrest (which may be different than the weapon used during the offense) and if this weapon (if it is a firearm) was an automatic weapon. There are a few completely new variables including the date of the arrest and the type of arrest. The type of arrest is simply whether the person was arrested by police who viewed the crime, if the arrest followed an arrest warrant or a previous arrest (i.e. arrested for a different crime and then police find out you also committed this one so they consider you arrested for this one too), and whether the person was cited by police and ordered to appear in court but not formally taken into custody. Finally, for juvenile arrestees it says whether arrestees were “handled within the department” which means they were released without formal sanctions or were “referred to other authorities” such as juvenile or criminal court, a welfare agency, or probation or parole department (for those on probation or parole). This chapter also covers the Group B Arrestee Segment and the Window Arrestee Segment. The Arrestee Segment covers arrests for Group A offenses and there are corresponding Offense, Offender, and Victim segments for these incidents. Group B offenses, however, only have information about the arrest so incidents in this segment do not have any corresponding segments with it. Since Group B only has arrests without any associated incident, instead of the incident number variable like other segments have, this segment has an “arrest transaction incident number” which works the same as a normal incident number. Likewise, the Window Arrestee Segment isn’t associated with any other segments as the “window” part means that they are only partial reports. The Window Arrestee Segment has the same variables as the normal Arrestee Segment but also has 10 variables on each of the offenses committed (up to 10 offenses) during the incident. This is really to try to provide a bit of information that you’d otherwise get from the other segments but don’t since this is a window segment. For the rest of this chapter I’ll be using examples from the Arrestee Segment and not the Group B Arrestee (except for a table showing each Group B offense) or the Window Arrestee Segment. 16.1 Important variables In addition to the variables detailed below this, segment has the traditional agency and incident identifiers: the ORI code, the agency state, the year of this data, and the incident number. It also has an “arrestee sequence number” which is an identifier for an arrestee in an incident since incidents can have multiple people arrested. This is just the number of each arrestee and to my knowledge is not associated with how involved the arrestee is. Being the 1st arrestee, for example, doesn’t mean that individual played a greater role in the crime than the 2nd arrestee. 16.1.1 Crimes arrested for This segment tells us which offense the arrestee was arrested for. There are a couple of caveats with this data. First, there can be up to 10 crimes per incident but this segment only tells you the most serious offense (based on the agency’s decision of which is most serious). This can be solved partially by merging this segment with the Offense Segment and getting all of the offenses related to the incident. It’s only partially solved because the crime the person is arrested for may not necessarily be the crime involved in the incident. This is because a person can be arrested for a certain crime (e.g. shoplifting) and then the police find out that there are also responsible for a more serious crime (e.g. aggravated assault). Their arrest crime is shoplifting and they’ll be associated with the incident for the aggravated assault. One interesting part of this segment is that while it’s associated with Group A offenses, as someone may be arrested for a crime other than the crime in the incident, arrests can include Group B offenses. So the Group B Arrestee Segment can really be thought of as an arrest for a Group B offense where the arrestee isn’t associated with a previous Group A incident (other than ones that already led to an arrest since that incident would then be considered clear and the present arrest won’t be associated with it). We’ll look first at the crimes people were arrested for in the main Arrestee Segment, which includes both Group A and Group B offenses as possible arrest crimes, and then at the Group B Arrestee Segment which only includes Group B offenses. 16.1.1.1 Arrestee Segment arrest crimes Table 16.1 shows the number and percent of arrests for all arrests associated with a Group A crime incident. Perhaps unsurprising, drug crimes are the most common arrest making up a quarter of all arrests (30% when including drug equipment crimes). Simple assault (assault without a weapon or without seriously injuring the victim) is the next most common at 19% of arrests, and aggravated assault is the 4th most common arrest crime at 6.3% of arrests. Theft, which NIBRS breaks into a number of subcategories of theft such as shoplifting and “all other larceny” is among the most common arrest crimes, making up ranks 3 and 6 of the top 6, as well as several other subcategories later on. The remaining crimes are all relatively rare, consisting of under 5% of arrests each. This is due to how the top crimes are broad categories (e.g. drug offenses ranges from simple possession to large scale sales but is all grouped into “drug/narcotic violations” here) while other crimes are specific (e.g. purse-snatching is a very specific form of theft). Table 16.1: Table 16.2: The number and percent of arrests for Group A crimes for all arrests reported to NIBRS in 2022.

The offense categories overlap with Table 16.1 but these are for separate arrests, a single arrest cannot be in both segments. Unhelpfully, the most common Group B offense is “All other offenses” which means that it’s a crime that isn’t covered in either the Group A or the Group B crime categories. However, this can also include Group A or Group B crimes if they are not completed. So an attempted or a conspiracy to commit a Group A or B crime can go in this category. At 57% of Group B arrests, this very vague category covers a huge amount of arrests. The next most common Group B arrest is driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol, and this occurred in 18.4% - or 352k times - of arrests. Trespassing makes up 5.7% of arrests and this is unlawfully entering someone’s property, including a building. The difference between this and burglary is that this is entering without any intent to commit theft or a felony. Disorderly conduct is a broad category ranging from indecent exposure (which should be its own sex offense but isn’t for some reason) to “profanity” and noise violations, and it makes up 6.2% of arrests. So be cautious with this offense as it ranges from very minor to quite serious and there’s no distinguishing what actually happened. Drunkenness and liquor law violations make up 6% and 3.6% of arrests, respectively. The difference is that drunkenness is when someone is seriously drunk in public (to the point where they can’t control their own body) and liquor law violations are about illegal making or selling of liquor. So basically bootlegging, selling alcohol without a license (or to people not allowed to drink, like minors), or avoiding paying tax on alcohol sales. “Family Offenses, Nonviolent” is also a rather vague category and includes “nonviolent abuse” (which I guess means emotional abusive) as well as neglecting the child in a few different ways like not paying alimony and deserting the child. Since these are arrests, the actions have to reach the level of criminal behavior, simply being an awful parent (or even leaving the child, as long as they have another adult to watch them) is not this offense. Runaways is an offense that only applies to people under age 18. The remaining categories are all rare and none are more than 1% of arrests. Table 16.3: The number and percent of arrests for Group B crimes for all arrests reported to NIBRS in 2022. Crime Category # of Offenses % of Offenses All Other Offenses 1,470,699 58.45% Driving Under The Influence 565,429 22.47% Trespass of Real Property 177,586 7.06% Disorderly Conduct 176,937 7.03% Liquor Law Violations 72,044 2.86% Family Offenses, Nonviolent 33,545 1.33% Curfew/Loitering/Vagrancy Violations 16,266 0.65% Failure To Appear 1,816 0.07% Runaway 1,629 0.06% Federal Resource Violations 15 0.00% Perjury 1 0.00% Total 2,515,967 100% 16.1.2 Arrest date For each arrest we know the exact date of the arrest. As with the incident date, there is evidence that when agencies don’t know the exact arrest date, they put down the first of the month. However, this is far less of a problem than with the incident date, likely because since the agency is doing the arresting they know exactly when they do it. Instead of looking at arrests by day of the month, we’ll use both the arrest date and the incident date to look at how long it takes for crimes to get solved. Figure 16.1 shows how long it takes for arrests to be made. The shortest time is zero days which means the arrest and the incident happened on the same day and the longest is 461 days after the incident. About 76.5% of arrests happen on the same day as the incident while 6.6% happen on the next day. 1.4% happen the following day and 1% on the day after this. This trend of a lower probability of the case being solved as the time from the incident increases continues throughout the figure. Including dates up to 461 days is a bit ridiculous since it’s impossible to see trends among the early dates other than zero days, but it’s a good demonstration of how massively concentrated arrests are that occur on the same day of the incident. The lesson here is that if an arrest isn’t made on the day of the incident (such as at the scene of the crime), it’s very unlikely that’ll it’ll be made at all (and most crimes never lead to an arrest). Figure 16.1: The distribution of the number of days from the incident to the arrest date. In 2022 the maximum days from incident to arrest was 461 days. Zero days means that the arrest occurred on the same day as the incident. Figure 16.2 groups the larger number of days together to make it easier to see trends early after the incident. Here we can see much better how the percent of arrests move quickly downwards after zero days. Figure 16.2: The number of days from the incident to the arrest date. Values over 10 days are grouped to better see the distribution for arrests that took fewer than 10 days. Zero days means that the arrest occurred on the same day as the incident. 16.1.3 Weapons In the Offense Segment we get info on what weapon (if any) was used during the crime. Here, we see what weapon the person arrested was carrying when they were arrested. There is probably a very large overlap here, especially given that the vast majority of arrests happen on the same day as the offense, so probably happen at the scene of the crime (and we’ll see exactly which ones do happen there later on in this chapter). Compared to the weapons covered in the Offense Segment - see Section 13.1.6 for more - the weapons here are only a narrow subset, and cover mostly firearms. This is partly because the most common “weapon” in the Offense Segment is that the offender used their body as a weapon (e.g. punching, kicking) and everyone arrested has a body so it doesn’t make sense to count that as a weapon. Each arrestee can carry up to two weapons, but we’ll only look at the first weapon for the below graphs. Please note that this is weapons found on the arrestee, and doesn’t mean that they used the weapon during the arrest. Figure 16.3 shows the breakdown in the weapon carried by the arrestee during the arrest. In 94% of arrests, the arrestee was not carrying any weapon. Since this graph shows arrests for all crimes, it makes a good deal of sense. Most crimes are non-violent so we’d expect those people to not carry a weapon. Since so few arrestees have weapons, we’ll look at the breakdown among those who were carrying a weapon in Figure 16.4. Figure 16.3: The weapon found on the arrestee for all arrestees reported in 2022. To see the weapons carried when the arrestee had a weapon, Figure 16.4 shows the breakdown in which weapon they carried. About 43.8% of people arrested who had a weapon were carrying a handgun followed by 30% with some kind of “lethal cutting instrument” like a knife. While rifles, and especially “assault rifles”, are what people (and especially politicians and the media) focus on when talking about violent crime, handguns are actually the most common gun to be used in a crime so it makes sense that handguns are the most frequently found weapon. “Firearm (type not stated)” basically means that the type of firearm used is unknown so can belong in one of the firearm categories and makes up 9% of weapons. Blunt instruments (including bats, clubs, and brass knuckles) follow at 6.9% of weapons. And the remaining weapons included are “other firearm” (so any other than ones specified) at 5.8%, rifle at 2.3%, and shotgun at 2%. Figure 16.4: The distribution of weapon usage for all arrestees in 2022 who were arrested with a weapon (i.e. excludes unarmed arrestees). 16.1.4 Automatic weapons This variable tells you if the weapon the arrestee was carrying was a gun whether that gun was fully automatic. To be clear, this means that when you pull the trigger once the gun will fire multiple bullets. Semi-automatic firearms are not automatic firearms. The Offense Segment also has a variable indicating if the offender used an automatic weapon but there they didn’t necessarily recover the gun so it’s much less reliable than in this segment where the police have the gun and are able to test it.103 The percent of guns that are fully automatic are fairly similar between the weapons seized at arrest, as shown in Figure 16.5 and those used in the offense as shown in Figure 13.3 in Chapter 13. Figure 16.5 shows that about 5.6% of rifles seized by police during an arrest were fully automatic. About 4.9% of handguns are automatic while “firearm (type not stated) are automatic in 4.3% of cases. Shotguns and”other firearm” category are the least likely to be automatic at about 2.5% and 1.1% of weapons, respectively. Figure 16.5: The percent of firearms the arrestee was carrying that were fully automatic, for arrestees in 2022. 16.1.5 Type of arrest While arrests are sometimes talked about as if they are a homogeneous group (likely in big part because UCR data doesn’t differentiate types of arrests), NIBRS data breaks them down into three different types of arrests. Figure 16.6 shows the distribution in the type of arrest for all arrestees in the 2022 NIBRS data. The most common type is “On-View” which means that the person is arrested at the scene by an officer. For example, if police respond to a bank robbery and nab the robbers as they run out of the bank, this is an on-view arrest. On-view arrests make up the majority - 50.9% - of arrests. The next type of arrest is a “warrant/previous incident report” and this makes up 26.8% of arrests. In these cases the police had an arrest warrant and found the person and arrested them based on that warrant. This also includes when a person is arrested and found to have been involved in previous incidents. Then these previous incidents would be considered cleared from this single arrest. In these cases NIBRS has an indicator variable, called the “multiple arrestee indicator” to tell us that this individual is responsible for multiple incidents cleared so we avoid counting them twice (as their demographics will be the same each time). In this variable it says “count arrestee” if this is their only arrest or if this is the first arrest that is counted in cases where multiple incidents are cleared by the arrest, and “multiple” otherwise. Finally, people can get a “summoned/cited” arrest which isn’t really an arrest at all. This is when they are given a subpoena that says that must go to court to be tried for a crime, but they are not formally arrested and taken into police custody (i.e. they are never handcuffed, taken to a police precinct or to jail). About 22.2% of arrests are this form of arrest. Figure 16.6: The distribution of arrests by type of arrest. Previous Incident Report includes cases where an individual was arrested for a separate crime and are then reported as also arrested for this incident. 16.1.6 Disposition for juvenile arrestees For juvenile arrestees - those under age 18 at the time of the arrest (and, by definition they’d also be under age 18 during the incident) - there is some information about the outcome of the arrest.104 There are two possible outcomes (which NIBRS calls “dispositions”): being referred to other (that is, other than the arresting agency) authorities or handled within the arresting agency. Figure 16.7 shows this breakdown and being referred to other authorities is the most common outcome at 72.6% of juvenile arrests. This is a very broad category and the “other authorities” can range from juvenile or adult court (so the police recommend that they be prosecuted) to welfare agencies and being sent to other police agencies (such as if they committed a crime elsewhere and are being extradited). The other category, being handled within the department, means that the police release the juvenile without any formal action taken (but they may give the juvenile a warning). In these cases the juvenile is released to an adult (including but not limited to family members or guardians) and the case is essentially dropped. In about 0.001% of juvenile arrests the disposition is unknown.105 Figure 16.7: For juvenile arrestees (under age 18), the distribution of case outcomes. 16.1.7 Demographics This segment provides several variables related to who the arrestee is. Age, race, and sex overlap with the Offender Segment but this segment also adds ethnicity and whether they live in the jurisdiction of the agency (i.e. the city the police patrols) they were arrested by. 16.1.7.1 Residence status The first variable we’ll look at is the residence status for the arrestee. This is residence in the jurisdiction that arrested them and it has nothing to do with residence status or citizenship status in the United States. People tend to commit crimes (and are the victims of crimes) very close to where they live, so this provides some evidence for that. We don’t know where the arrestee lives, but know if they live in the jurisdiction or not. This is useful because some areas (e.g. Las Vegas, Washington DC, urban city centers where people commute to work) likely have a lot more people moving into those areas during the day but who live else compared to places like rural towns or suburbs. So it’s helpful to be able to distinguish locals arrested with people who may be tourists or come into town just to commit the crime.106 One thing to be cautious about is that residence status may be an imprecise measure of where someone actually lives. How it’s defined may differ by agency which could affect comparability across agencies. For example, if it’s defined as official residence (such as address on a driver’s license) that may be incorrect for a sizable share of the population (e.g. many college students live far from where their driver’s license address is).107 If residence status is based on asking the arrestee, they may of course lie to the police. There’s also the question of how to label people who are truly transient such as homeless people who may move from city to city. The FBI defines residence as their legal permanent address though it’s unclear how that is handled for people without this info and when people live permanently in a different spot than their legal address. Figure 16.8 shows the percent of arrestees in 2022 who were residents or not (or whose status was unknown) of the jurisdiction that arrested them. Most people were arrested near where they live, with 56.9% of arrestees being residents, compared with 23.3% not being residents. However, about one-fifth of arrestees had an unknown residence status so the percents of resident and non-resident may change dramatically if we didn’t have any unknowns. Figure 16.8: The distribution of residence status for all arrestees reported to NIBRS in 2022. Residence status is residence in the arresting agency’s jurisdiction (e.g. do you live in the city you were arrested in?). It is unrelated to citizenship or immigration status. 16.1.7.2 Age This variable is the age at the arrest, which may be different than age during the crime. As in the Offender Segment we are given the exact age (in years) but agencies can input a range of possible ages with the FBI giving us the average of this range (rounding down, not to the nearest integer) in the data. In Figure 14.1 in the Offense Segment, this can be seen in the sudden spikes in the percent of offenders of a certain age and that some of the most common ages are divisible by five (e.g. 20, 25, 30). There are also far fewer unknown ages in this data with only 0.1% of arrestees having a missing age. This is reasonable as a person arrested is present for the police to learn their age from something like a driver’s license or past criminal records, or estimate the age by looking at the arrestee. Like in the Offender Segment, age as a specific year is cutoff at 98 with all older ages grouped simply as “over 98 years old”. Figure 16.9 shows the percent of arrestees at every age available. Relative to Figure 14.1, this graph is far smoother, indicating that there was less estimating ages and more knowing the actual age. While the trend is the same for both of these graphs, the arrestee data doesn’t have any odd spikes with certain ages. Age we see that the percent of people arrested increases as they age, peaking in the early twenties before declining and then peaking age even higher in the late 20s. After this, there is a long steady decline as the arrestee ages. Figure 16.9: The age of all arrestees reported in the 2022 NIBRS data. 16.1.7.3 Sex We also know the sex of the arrestee. The only options for this variable are male and female and there is never missing data so the police always choose one of these two choices. There is no option for transgender or any other identity. Figure 16.10 shows the distribution of arrestees by sex. The vast majority, 70.5% of arrestees are male and the remaining 29.5% are female. This is a higher rate of female arrestees than you might expect - past research has found that crime is largely a male-phenomenon, even greater than found here (though “crime” in most criminology research is only murder or violent index crimes) - and that’s because there are differences in sex involvement by type of crime. For rape, as an example, 97.8% of arrestees in 2022 were male. Shoplifting was an even 50% split between female and male arrestees. Figure 16.10: The sex of all arrestees reported in the 2022 NIBRS data. 16.1.7.4 Race For each arrestee we know their race, with possible races being White, Black, American Indian/Alaskan Native, Asian, and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander. Unlike sex, the police can say that the race is unknown.108 As each arrestee is visible to the police, and can self-report race or provide official records (e.g. criminal history or jail admission data) which may say their race, there is far less uncertainty for arrestee race than offender race where 38.5% of the data is missing. As with any measure of race there is still some degree of uncertainty since people’s race are not always obvious and may not fit tidily into each of the mutually exclusive groups available in NIBRS data (e.g. there is no option for mixed race). Figure 16.11 shows the breakdown for the races of each arrestee. White arrestees are most common at 64.2% of arrestees, following by Black arrestees at 29.8%. Only 3.1% of arrestees have an unknown race. The remaining small share of arrestees is made up of American Indian/Alaskan Native at 1.6%, Asian at 1%, and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander at 0.3% of arrestees. Figure 16.11: The race of all arrestees reported in the 2022 NIBRS data. 16.1.7.5 Ethnicity Finally, there is data on the race of the arrestee so we know if they are Hispanic or not. Ethnicity is so poorly used in the UCR data (e.g. UCR stopped collecting it for arrests for most years available and most agencies still don’t report it) that I recommended in the UCR book against ever using it. For NIBRS, there is far less data missing so it’s not as much of a problem to use ethnicity as it is with UCR data. The issue remains as to what agencies are actually reporting this data or in which scenarios this variable is reported or not even in agencies that generally do report it. Ethnicity is an optional variable so agencies are never required to report it. This means that there’s a greater chance that it’ll be used only in non-random situations (which would make the data biased in some unknown way). There’s also the question of reliability of the ethnicity data. Someone being Hispanic or not is likely just what the arrestees calls themselves or what the arresting officer perceives them to be. Both are important ways of measuring ethnicity but get at different things. Perception is more important for studies of bias, self-identification for differences among groups of people such as arrest rates by ethnicity. And the subjectivity of who is classified as Hispanic means that this measurement may differ by agency and by officer, making it imprecise. Figure 16.12 shows the breakdown in arrests by arrestee ethnicity. Most arrestees - 72.5% - are not Hispanic. Only 10% are reported to be Hispanic but an even higher percent of arrestees - 16.8% - have an unknown ethnicity so the true percent or Hispanic or non-Hispanic arrestee may be different than shown here. Figure 16.12: The ethnicity of all arrestees reported in the 2022 NIBRS data. It’s not clear whether they actually test it or simply go by the design of the gun, such as if the model allows for fully automatic firing.↩︎ There are a few people older than 18 with this variable but it’s so rare that I think that they’re just incorrectly inputted ages.↩︎ A juvenile can potentially get multiple dispositions, such as if they’re initially released but later the police recommend them for prosecution. It’s not clear which outcome is recorded in these cases. In UCR data, however, only the initial disposition is recorded so that is likely how it also is in NIBRS.↩︎ In a ridealong I was on a woman who lived over an hour from the city I was in was caught shoplifting clothes.↩︎ One another ridealong a man from Florida was arrested for stealing from a local store (in California).↩︎ I’ve been told that measuring race at all is itself racist so should never been done, even in research. This from a group of people who also said they have no need to actually evaluate police racial bias properly (i.e. using a regression with control variables) since they already knew the answer. If you agree with this, please don’t ever do research on anything, you’ll do it poorly.↩︎ "],["property.html", "Chapter 17 Property and Window Property Segment 17.1 Important variables", " Chapter 17 Property and Window Property Segment The Property Segment provides a bit more info than would be expected from the name. For each item involved in the crime it tells you what category that items falls into, with 68 total categories (including “other”) ranging from explosives and pets to money and alcohol. It also tells you the estimated value of that item. This data covers more than just items stolen during a crime. For each item it tells you what happened to that item such as if it was stolen, damaged, seized by police (such as illegal items like drugs), recovered (from being stolen) by police, or burned during an arson. For drug offenses it includes the drugs seized by police. For these offenses, the data tells us the type of drug, with 16 different drug categories ranging from specific ones like marijuana or heroin to broader categories such as “other narcotics”. There can be up to three different drugs included in this data - if the person has more than three types of drugs seized then the third drug category will simply indicate that there are more than three drugs, so we learn what the first two drugs are but not the third or greater drugs are in these cases. For each drug we also know exactly how much was seized with one variable saying the amount the police found and another saying the units we should we reading that amount as (e.g. pills, grams, plants). 17.1 Important variables In addition to the variables detailed below, this segment has the traditional agency and incident identifiers: the ORI code, the agency state, the year of this data, the incident number, and the incident date. The Window Property Segment has the same variables as the normal Property Segment but also has 10 variables on each of the offenses committed (up to 10 offenses) during the incident. This is really to try to provide a bit of information that you’d otherwise get from the other segments but don’t since this is a window segment. For the rest of this chapter I’ll be using examples from the Property Segment and not the Window Property. 17.1.1 Type of property loss This segment contains information on all property involved in the incident, other than the weapon used by the offender. Property can be involved in multiple ways - such as being stolen, destroyed, or that the stolen property is recovered by the police - so NIBRS breaks this info into seven different categories (eight when including “unknown” type). Figure 17.1 shows each of these categories as how often they occur. The most common category, at 60.7% of the rows in this segment, is when the item is taken from the victim by the offender. This includes when the offender stole the item, took it by force in a robbery, tricked the victim (e.g. offender committed fraud), and any other way to illegal get the item (e.g. extortion, ransom, bribery). Though it includes all these types of ways to illegally take the item, it is often just called “stolen” property and I’ll refer to it as such in this chapter just for simplicity of writing. The next most common group, at 13.3%, is when the item was seized by the police. This excludes items that were stolen and that the police recovered. It includes all types of property that the offender illegally had but is primary for drug crimes where the drug or drug equipment was seized. This segment also includes property damaged, destroyed, or vandalized by the offender and this type makes up 11.2% of the data. Following this, about 9% of rows are for recovered property which is when one of the previously stolen items is recovered by the police. Next is “none” which only means that no property was stolen or damaged but that it could have been. For example, if someone tries to grab a person’s purse but fails, that would be considered “none” since the purse wasn’t actually taken. The remaining types are when the item was a counterfeit/forgery, at 1.2%, was burned (such as during an arson) at 0.2%, or when the type of loss is unknown at 0.2% Figure 17.1: The type of loss or if the item is recovered. 17.1.2 Description of property There are 68 different categories of properties (including the catch-all “other” category for anything not explicitly in a different category) that NIBRS covers. This also includes “identity - intangible” which means that someone stole the victim’s identity. Identity isn’t property since it’s not a physical thing but is nonetheless included here (items related to one’s identity such as social security cards are included in a different category called “identity documents”). Each of these categories can appear in any of the seven different types of property loss discussed above. For simplicity of writing, and because Table 17.1 covers items stolen, I’ll be talking below about items lost by being stolen, though everything does apply to other types of loss too. The property included in NIBRS can move from very broad categories like “merchandise” to more specific items such as livestock, aircraft, and pets. The property categories are mutually exclusive so a single item cannon be counted in different categories. If, for example, laptop is stolen that could potentially go in “computer hardware/software” or “office-type equipment” but it wouldn’t be in both, it would only be recorded in one of the two. In cases where multiple items of the same type are stolen - such as someone stealing multiple laptops in a single crime - we don’t actually know how many items were stolen. Just that at least one item of that category was stolen in the incident. We then know the total estimated value of the items stolen in that incident which we can use to estimate the number of items stolen (as long as the know the average value per item in that category) though this would be a very imprecise measure. The exception to this is for stolen vehicles where we know exactly how many were stolen and how many were recovered. Table 17.1 shows each of the 68 different types of property in NIBRS and shows the number of incidents where they were stolen for all incidents in the 2022 NIBRS data. Multiple different categories of property can be stolen in a single incident. The most common type of property stolen, at 14.3% of all property is “other” which isn’t really that helpful to us. We know it’s not one of the other 67 categories but not exactly what was stolen. Next, are money at 11.8% and then purses/handbags/wallets at 5.6%. This makes a lot of sense. People steal things for financial gain and the easiest way to get that gain is stealing money directly (or wallets and purses which often have money inside). Stealing property that you then have to sell or trade to get what you want (money or other property) is a lot harder, which is likely why it’s less common. There are about 4.8 million rows in the Property Segment where the item was stolen (the other 3.1 million rows are about property that was seized by police, recovered, damaged, or one of the other types of property loss detailed in Section 17.1.1). As such, even items stolen very rarely can occur thousands or tens of thousands of times. For example, pets were the property stolen about 0.14% of the time and that tiny percent still accounts of 6,821 incidents with a pet stolen. Given the huge number of rows in this data - and as more agencies report to NIBRS this will grow quickly - it can be possible to study specific types of property, such as pets stolen, that wouldn’t be possible with a more narrow dataset (both in terms of how specific the items they include are, and the size of the data).

This includes atypical property like building material, musical instruments, and pets (and leads me to think that at least some of this is incorrectly labeled as property seized by the police). The vast majority of property seized by police, however, is drugs. 63.2% of the property seized were drugs themselves while 27.3% were equipment related to the drugs. The remaining items were mostly “other” (i.e. anything not explicitly categorized here) at 2.6%, money at 2%, firearms at 0.9%, and then a bunch of very rarely seized items.

This is estimates by the police but is supposed to be the current value of the item (e.g. a stolen car is what it currently sells for, not what the buyer bought it for) and is the cost it’ll take for the victim to replace the item. To be a bit more specific, this variable is the sum of items stolen in this category. For example, if someone burglarizes a house and steals three rings from the victim, this would not count as three thefts of a ring. It would be recorded as loss of jewelry and the value would be the total value of all three rings. The police can take the victim’s estimation into consideration but aren’t supposed to immediately accept it as victims may exaggerate values (especially for insurance purposes). When items are recovered, the police put in the value at the time of recovery which may be substantially different than at the time of the loss if the item is damaged or destroyed. We can use this variable to look at the value of items lost by the victim. Figure 17.2 looks at the value per item stolen in a crime (if incidents have multiple items stolen, this counts them all separately). This includes items lost by theft, robbery, and burglary so is part of the “Stolen/Robbed/Etc.” category of types of property loss. It excludes items damaged or destroyed or burned (there is info about the value of property in these incidents but these are not shown in the figure). To make this graph a bit simpler I’ve rounded all values to the nearest $100 so items valued at $0 mean that they are worth between $1 and $50. I’ve also capped the largest value to $1,000,000 and set the x-axis on the log scale since the data skews very much to the right. The average item lost was worth $3,217 and the median was worth $150. Most items lost were relative cheap with 34.9% worth under $50 and 13.5% worth between $51 and $149. There is a sharp decline in the frequency of property stolen as the value increases. So while some extremely valuable items are lost during crimes, they are much less common than relatively low-value items. Figure 17.2: The distribution of the value of property stolen. Values are capped at 1,000,000 and each value is rounded to the nearest 100. The x-axis is set on the log scale as this distribution is hugely right skewed. Since multiple items can be stolen in a single incident, to better understand the cost of crime for the victim we probably want to add up all of the property to the incident-level. Figure 17.2 does this and shows the cost of property stolen per incident. The trend is nearly identical to Figure 17.2 but the value is a bit higher than before. Now fewer than a quarter of incidents result in a loss of &lt;$50 and the average cost per incident is $4,731 (median = $300). Figure 17.3: The incident-level distribution of the value of property stolen. As values are aggregated to the incident-level, these are higher than the above graph which shows each item individually. Values are capped at 1,000,000 and each value is rounded to the nearest 100. The x-axis is set on the log scale as this distribution is hugely right skewed. 17.1.4 Date property was recovered This segment tells us both when the incident happened and, for stolen property, when the item was recovered. We can use this to look at how long it generally takes for property to be recovered (though most property stolen is never recovered). Figure 17.4 shows the number of days it takes for property to be recovered. Though this data gives us the exact date, allowing for the precise number of days from property loss to recovery, this graph groups days greater than nine days to simplify the graph. The maximum number of days in the 2022 NIBRS data is 450 days so showing all days would be a rather unhelpful graph. The majority - 60.8% - of property lost is recovered on the same day, which is shown as zero days. We saw in Figure 16.1 that the vast majority of arrests happen on the same day as the incident so it makes sense the most property would too.109 A smaller and smaller share of property is recovered as the number of days from the incident increase, a trend also found in the time to arrest graph. The lesson here seems to be that if you’re a victim of a crime and had something taken, unless it’s recovered very quickly it’s unlikely to be recovered at all. Figure 17.4: The distribution of the number of days from the incident to the property recovered date. In 2022 the maximum days from incident to arrest was 456 days. Zero days means that the arrest occurred on the same day as the incident. 17.1.5 Drugs This segment also provides information about drugs seized by the police. This also includes cases where the police would have seized the drugs if the offender didn’t destroy it somehow, such as flushing it down the toilet. For each drug seized there is information on what type of drug it was and how much of the drug was seized. There can be up to three drugs seized in an incident and data is available for each type of drug. The exception, however, is when there are more than three drugs seized in an incident. In that case, info on the third drug just says that there were more than three drugs involved. So you’d have info on the first two drugs but none on the third through however many (and it doesn’t say how many) drugs. For the below table and figure I only look at the first drug seized, so the numbers shown are undercounts. The ordering of drugs when there are multiple drugs is based on how much drugs were recovered and the seriousness of the drugs. For example, heroin is probably considered more serious than marijuana, but overall ranking of drugs is a subjective assessment depending on the department. Is heroin more serious than meth? That decision likely varies by the agency and their situation in regard to what drugs they often seize. 17.1.5.1 Suspected drug type The drugs in NIBRS are the “suspected drug types” which means that they are what the police believe the drugs to be, even if there is not definitive proof (such as a crime lab testing for what type of drug it is) that the drug is what they say it is. There are 15 possible drug types in NIBRS (16 when including “unknown drug type”) and each is shown in Table 17.3 along with how often they occur in the data. Some of these drug types are specific enough to only include a single drug while others are groups of drug types, such as hallucinogens or stimulants (and they include all of these types other than specifically stated drugs). Not too surprising, marijuana is the most common drug seized at 47% - or 455k incidents with it seized - of the data. This is followed by amphetamines/methamphetamines (including what we’d normally just call meth) at 20.7% and then heroin at 8.5%. Interestingly, cocaine and crack cocaine (which are always separate categories) both occur in 5.09% of drugs seized. Given the large disparity in sentences for these types of drugs, and that “crack wars” were a major purported cause of violent crime in the 1980s and 1990s, I expected crack cocaine to be much more common than normal cocaine. The remaining drug types are all less than 5% of drugs seized each and has some groupings of drug types (e.g. stimulants) rather than specific drug types (though some of these categories, such as LSD, are specific drugs). Table 17.3: The number and percent of drugs seized by police by type of drug, for all drugs seized in 2022. Drug Type # of Drugs % of Drugs Marijuana 557,044 44.09% Amphetamines/Methamphetamines 301,759 23.88% Other Narcotics: Codeine, Demerol, Dihydromorphinone Or Dilaudid, Hydrocodone Or Percodan, Methadone, Etc. 78,941 6.25% Cocaine (All Forms Except Crack) 73,157 5.79% Heroin 68,859 5.45% Crack Cocaine 64,853 5.13% Other Drugs: Antidepressants (Elavil, Triavil, Tofranil, Etc.), Aromatic Hydrocarbons, Propoxyphene Or Darvon, Tranquilizers (Chlordiazepoxide Or Librium, Diazepam Or Valium, Etc.), Etc. 47,748 3.78% Unknown Type Drug 26,787 2.12% Opium 11,881 0.94% Other Hallucinogrens: BMDA (White Acid), DMT, MDA, MDMA, Mescaline Or Peyote, Psilocybin, STP, Etc. 8,799 0.70% Hashish 6,963 0.55% Other Depressants: Glutethimide Or Doriden, Methaqualone Or Quaalude, Pentazocine Or Talwin, Etc. 6,825 0.54% Other Stimulants: Adipex, Fastine And Ionamin (Derivatives of Phentermine), Benzedrine, Didrex, Methylphenidate Or Ritalin, Phenmetrazine Or Preludin, Tenuate, Etc. 3,996 0.32% Barbiturates 1,582 0.13% PCP 1,510 0.12% LSD 1,461 0.12% Morphine 1,271 0.10% Total 1,263,436 100% 17.1.5.2 Amount of drugs For each drug type we know exactly how much was seized (at least we do other than for the 6.7% where the amount is “not reported”). Since different drug types are measured in different ways, this data also tells us what units the amount seized is in. So you’ll need to look at both the amount and the units to understand how much drugs were actually seized. The possible units are listed below: Dosage Unit/Items (Pills, Etc.) Fluid Ounce Gallon Gram Kilogram Liter Milliliter Number of Plants Ounce Pound Once you know the units you can look at the amount of drugs seized. The amount is specific up to the thousandths place though the integer and the numbers after the decimal point are actually in different columns in the data. For example, if police seized 1.257 grams of heroin, the 1 gram and the 0.257 grams would be in separate columns. As an example, we’ll look at Figure 17.5 which shows the number of grams seized for marijuana. This is only looking at the column with the amount in integers, so parts of a gram are excluded (but are available in the data). This also excludes any case where the marijuana seized was measured in a unit other than gram, such as number of plants, ounces, or pounds. Even though the data shows the number of grams as actual integers, not grouped at all, I do group the larger values together to make the graph simpler. So with those caveats, we can see what amounts of marijuana, measured in grams, are most frequently seized. Generally, the amount of marijuana seized is in small amounts with 22.5% being 1-2 grams (since we don’t include the parts of a gram we can only say that it is 1 to 1.999 grams) and 18.6% being less than one gram. As the amount of drugs increase, the percent of seizures that involve this number of drugs decreases. It’s a bit curious that they include grams for values over 28 since 28.3495 grams is one ounce so it’d make sense to just start reporting in units of ounces instead of just increasingly large number of grams. Figure 17.5: For drugs seized that are measured in grams, this figure shows the distribution in the number of grams seized. Values over 10 grams are grouped together for easier interpretation of lower values of drugs seized. I’d expect most property to be recovered on the arrestee’s body.↩︎ "],["references.html", "References", " References Bennice, Jennifer A, and Patricia A Resick. 2003. “Marital Rape: History, Research, and Practice.” Trauma, Violence, &amp; Abuse 4 (3): 228–46.
