UCR data is, with the exception of the more detailed data that only covers murders, a monthly number of crimes or arrests reported to a single police agency which is then gathered by the FBI into one file that includes all reporting agencies. It is actually a collection of different datasets, all of which have information about crimes and arrests that occur in a particular jurisdiction. Think of your home town. This data will tell you how many crimes were reported for a small number of crime categories or how many people (broken down by age, sex, and race) were arrested for a (larger) set of crime categories in that city (if the city has multiple police agencies then each agency will report crimes/arrests under their jurisdiction though the largest agency - usually the local police department - will cover the vast majority of crimes/arrests in that city) in a given month. This is a very broad measure of crime, and its uses in research - or uses for understanding crime at all - is fairly limited. Yet is has become over much of the last century - and will likely remain among researchers for at least the next decade - the most important crime data in the United States. UCR data is important for three reasons: The definitions are standard, and all agencies (tend to) follow them so you can compare across agencies and over time.1 The data is available since 1960 (for most of the datasets) so there is a long period of available data.2 The data is available for most of the 18,000 police agencies in the United States so you can compare across agencies. More than many other datasets, there will be times when using UCR data that you will think “that is weird”. This book will cover this weirdness and when we think the weirdness is just an odd - but acceptable - quirk of the data, and when it is a sign of a big problem in the data or in that particular variable and that we should avoid using it. For most of this book we will be discussing the caveats of the above reasons - or, more directly, why these assumptions are wrong - but these are the reasons why the data is so influential. Figure 1.1: The annual percent of the United States population that is covered by an agency reporting data to NIBRS. Figure 1.2: The percent of each state’s population that is covered by police agencies reporting at least one month of data to NIBRS, 2022. 1.1 Goal of the book By the end of each chapter you should have a firm grasp on the dataset that is covered and how to use it properly. However, this book cannot possibly cover every potential use case for the data so make sure to carefully examine the data yourself for your own particular use. I get a lot of emails from people asking questions about this data so my own goal is to create a single place that answers as many questions as I can about the data. Again, this is among the most commonly used crime datasets and there are still many current papers published with incorrect information about the data (including such simple aspects like what geographic unit data is in and what time unit it is in). So hopefully this book will decrease the number of misconceptions about this data, increasing overall research quality. 1.2 Structure of the book This book will be divided into ten chapters: this chapter, an intro chapter briefly summarizing each dataset and going over overall issues with UCR data, and seven chapters each covering one of the seven UCR datasets. The final chapter will cover county-level UCR data, a commonly used but highly flawed aggregation of UCR data that I recommend against using. Each chapter will follow the same format: we will start with a brief summary of the data such as when it first because available and how it can be used. Next we will look at how many agencies report their data to this dataset, often looking at how to measure this reporting rate a couple of different ways. Finally, we will cover the important variables included in the data and how to use them properly (including not using them at all) - this will be the bulk of each chapter. 1.3 Citing this book If this data was useful in your research, please cite it.

First, and probably most commonly used, is the data put together by the National Archive of Criminal Justice Data (NACJD)). This a team out of the University of Michigan who manages a huge number of criminal justice datasets and makes them available to the public. If you have any questions about crime data - UCR or other crime data - I highly recommend you reach out to them for answers. They have a collection of data and excellent documentation available for UCR data available on their site here. One limitation to their data, however, is that each year of data is available as an individual file meaning that you will need to concatenate each year together into a single file. Some years also have different column names (generally minor changes like spelling robbery “rob” one year and “robb” the next) which requires more work to standardize before you could concatenate. They also only have data through 2016 which means that the most recent years (UCR data is available through 2019) of data are (as of this writing) unavailable. Next, and most usable for the general public - but limited for researchers - is the FBI’s official website Crime Data Explorer. On this site you can chose an agency and see annual crime data (remember, UCR data is monthly so this is not as detailed as it can be) for certain crimes (and not even all the crimes actually available in the data). This is okay for the general public but only provides a fraction of the data available in the actual data so is really not good for researchers. It is worth mentioning a final source of UCR information. This is the annual Crimes in the United States report released by the FBI each year around the start of October. As an example, here is the website for the 2019 report. In this report is summarized data which in most cases estimates missing data and provides information about national and subnational (though rarely city-level) crime data. As with the FBI’s site, it is only a fraction of the true data available so is not a very useful source of crime data for quality research. Still, this is a very common source of information used by researchers. 1.5 Recommended reading While this book is designed to help researchers use this data, the FBI has an excellent manual on this data designed to help police agencies submit their data. That manual, called the “Summary Reporting System (SRS) User Manual” provides excellent definitions and examples of many variables included in the data. In this book when I quote the FBI, such as defining a crime, I quote from this manual. The manual is available to download as a PDF on the FBI’s site and I have also posted it on my GitHub page here for convenience. I highly recommend that you read this manual before using the data. That manual, alongside this book which tries to explain when and how the agencies do not follow the manual, will provide a solid foundation for your understanding of UCR data. 1.6 How to contribute to this book If you have any questions, suggestions (such as a topic to cover), or find any issues, please make a post on the Issues page for this book on GitHub. On this page you can create a new issue (which is basically just a post on this forum) with a title and a longer description of your issue. You will need a GitHub account to make a post. Posting here lets me track issues and respond to your message or alert you when the issue is closed (i.e. I have finished or denied the request). Issues are also public so you can see if someone has already posted something similar. For more minor issues like typos or grammar mistakes, you can edit the book directly through its GitHub page. That will make an update for me to accept, which will change the book to include your edit. To do that, click the edit button at the top of the site - the button is highlighted in the below figure. You will need to make a GitHub account to make edits. When you click on that button you will be taken to a page that looks like a Word Doc where you can make edits. Make any edits you want and then scroll to the bottom of the page. There you can write a short (please, no more than a sentence or two) description of what you have done and then submit the changes for me to review. Figure 1.3: The edit button for how to make edits of this book. Please only use the above two methods to contribute or make suggestions about the book. While it is a bit more work for you to do it this way, since you will need to make a GitHub account if you do not already have one, it helps me organize all the questions in one place and update the book if I decide to add answers to certain questions. 1.7 How to identify a particular agency (ORI codes) In NIBRS and other FBI data sets, agencies are identified using ORiginating Agency Identifiers or an ORI. An ORI is a unique ID code used to identify an agency.3 If we used the agency’s name we would end up with some duplicates since there can be multiple agencies in the country (and in a state, those this is very rare) with the same name. For example, if you looked for the Philadelphia Police Department using the agency name, you would find both the “Philadelphia Police Department” in Pennsylvania and the one in Mississippi. Each ORI is a 9-digit value starting with the state abbreviation4 followed by 7 numbers. In the UCR data (another FBI data set) the ORI uses only a 7-digit code - with only the 5 numbers following the state abbreviation instead of 7. So the NIBRS ORI codes are sometimes called ORI9. For nearly all agencies, the only difference between the UCR ORI and the NIBRS ORI is that the NIBRS ORI has “00” at the end so it is technically 9 characters long but is not any more specific than the 7-character UCR ORI code. When dealing with specific agencies, make sure to use the ORI rather than the agency name to avoid any mistakes. For an easy way to find the ORI number of an agency, use this page on my site. Type an agency name or an ORI code into the search section and it will return everything that is a match. 1.8 The data as you get it from the FBI We will finish this overview of the SRS data by briefly talking about format of the data that is released by the FBI, before the processing done by myself or NACJD that converts the data to a type that software like R or Stata or Excel can understand. The FBI releases their data as fixed-width ASCII files which are basically just an Excel file but with all of the columns squished together. As an example, Figure 1.4 shows what the data looks like as you receive it from the FBI for the Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest dataset for 1960, the first year with data available. In the figure, it seems like there are multiple rows but that is just because the software that I opened the file in is not wide enough - in reality what is shown is a single row that is extremely wide because there are over 1,500 columns in this data. If you scroll down enough you will see the next row, but that is not shown in the current image. What is shown is a single row with a ton of columns all pushed up next to each other. Since all of the columns are squished together (the gaps are just blank spaces because the value there is a space, but that does not mean there is a in the data. Spaces are possible values in the data and are meaningful), you need some way to figure out which parts of the data belong in which column. Figure 1.4: Fixed-width ASCII file for the 1960 Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest dataset. Figure 1.5: Fixed-width ASCII file for the 1991 National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) dataset. The “fixed-width” part of the file type is how this works (the ASCII part basically means it is a text file). Each row is the same width - literally the same number of characters, including blank spaces. So you must tell the software you are using to process this file - by literally writing code in something called a “setup file” but is basically just instructions for whatever software you use (R, SPSS, Stata, SAS can all do this) - which characters are certain columns. For example, in this data the first character says which type of SRS data it is (1 means the Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest data) and the next two characters (in the setup file written as 2-3 since it is characters 2 through 3 [inclusive]) are the state number (01 is the state code for Alabama). So we can read this row as the first column indicating it is an Offenses Known data, the second column indicating that it is for the state of Alabama, and so on for each of the remaining columns. To read in this data you will need a setup file that covers every column in the data (some software, like R, can handle just reading in the specific columns you want and do not need to include every column in the setup file). The second important thing to know about reading in a fixed-width ASCII file is something called a “value label.”5 For example, in the above image we saw the characters 2-3 is the state and in the row we have the value “01” which means that the state is “Alabama.” Since this type of data is trying to be as small as efficient as possible, it often replaces longer values with shorter one and provides a translation for the software to use to convert it to the proper value when reading it. “Alabama” is more characters than “01” so it saves space to say “01” and just replace that with “Alabama” later on. So “01” would be the “value” and “Alabama” would be the “label” that it changes to once read. Fixed-width ASCII files may seem awful to you reading it today, and it is awful to use. But it appears to be an efficient way to store data back many decades ago when data releases began but now is extremely inefficient - in terms of speed, file size, ease of use - compared to modern software so I am not sure why they still release data in this format. But they do, and even the more modern NIBRS data comes in this format. For you, however, the important part to understand is not how exactly to read this type of data, but to understand that people who made this data publicly available (such as myself and the team at NACJD) must make this conversion process.6 This conversion process, from fixed-width ASCII to a useful format is the most dangerous step taken in using this data - and one that is nearly entirely unseen by researchers. Every line of code you write (or, for SPSS users, click you make) invites the possibility of making a mistake.7 The FBI does not provide a setup file with the fixed-width ASCII data so to read in this data you need to make it yourself. Since some SRS data are massive, this involves assigning the column width for thousands of columns and the value labels for hundreds of different value labels.8 A typo anywhere could have potentially far-reaching consequences, so this is a crucial weak point in the data cleaning process - and one in which I have not seen anything written about before. While I have been diligent in checking the setup files and my code to seek out any issues - and I know that NACJD has a robust checking process for their own work - that does not mean our work is perfect.9 Even with perfection in processing the raw data to useful files, decisions we make (e.g. what level to aggregate to, what is an outlier) can affect both what type of questions you can ask when using this data, and how well you can answer them. 1.9 Common issues In this section we will discuss issues common to most or all of the SRS datasets. For some of these, we will come back to the issues in more detail in the chapter for the datasets most affected by the problem. 1.9.1 Population Each of the SRS datasets include a population variable that has the estimated population under the jurisdiction of that agency.10 This variable is often used to create crime rates that control for population. In cases where jurisdiction overlaps, such as when a city has university police agencies or county sheriffs in counties where the cities in that county have their own police, SRS data assigns the population covered to the most local agency and zero population to the overlapping agency. So an agency’s population is the number of people in that jurisdiction that is not already covered by a different agency. For example, the city of Los Angeles in California has nearly four million residents according to the US Census. There are multiple police agencies in the city, including the Los Angeles Police Department, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Office, the California Highway Patrol that operates in the area, airport and port police, and university police departments. If each agency reported the number of people in their jurisdiction - which all overlap with each other - we would end up with a population far higher than LA’s four million people. To prevent double-counting population when agency’s jurisdictions overlap, the non-primary agency will report a population of 0, even though they still report crime data like normal. As an example, in 2018 the police department for California State University - Los Angeles reported 92 thefts and a population of 0. Those 92 thefts are not counted in the Los Angeles Police Department data, even though the department counts the population. To get complete crime counts in Los Angeles, you would need to add up all police agencies within in the city; since the population value is 0 for non-LAPD agencies, both the population and the crime sum will be correct. The SRS uses this method even when only parts of a jurisdiction overlaps. Los Angeles County Sheriff has a population of about one million people, far less than the actual county population (the number of residents, according to the Census) of about 10 million people. This is because the other nine million people are accounted for by other agencies, mainly the local police agencies in the cities that make up Los Angeles County. The population value is the population who reside in that jurisdiction and does not count people who are in the area but do not live there, such as tourists or people who commute there for work. This means that using the population value to determine a rate can be misleading as some places have much higher numbers of non-residents in the area (e.g. Las Vegas, Washington D.C.) than others. 1.9.2 Voluntary reporting When an agency reports their data to the FBI, they do so voluntarily - there is no national requirement to report.11 This means that there is inconsistency in which agencies report, how many months of the year they report for, and which variables they include in their data submissions. In general, more agencies report their data every year and once an agency begins reporting data they tend to keep reporting. The SRS datasets are a collection of separate, though related, datasets and an agency can report to as many of these datasets as they want - an agency that reports to one dataset does not mean that they report to other datasets. Figure 1.6 shows the number of agencies that submitted at least one month of data to the Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest data in the given year. For the first decade of available data under 8,000 agencies reported data and this grew to over 13,500 by the late 1970s before plateauing for about a decade. The number of agencies that reported their data actually declined in the 1990s, driven primarily by many Florida agencies temporarily dropping out, before growing steadily to nearly 17,000 agencies in 2010; from here it kept increasing but slower than before. Figure 1.6: The annual number of agencies reporting to the Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest dataset. Reporting is based on the agency reporting at least one month of data in that year. There are approximately 18,000 police agencies in the United States so recent data has reports from nearly all agencies, while older data has far fewer agencies reporting. When trying to estimate to larger geographies, such as state or national-level, later years will be more accurate as you are missing less data. For earlier data, however, you are dealing with a smaller share of agencies meaning that you have a large amount of missing data and a less representative sample. Figure 1.7 repeats the above figure but now including only agencies with 100,000 people or more in their jurisdiction. While these agencies have a far more linear trend than all agencies, the basic lesson is the same: recent data has most agencies reporting; old data excludes many agencies. Figure 1.7: The annual number of agencies with a population of 100,000 or higher reporting to the Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest dataset. Reporting is based on the agency reporting at least one month of data in that year. This voluntariness extends beyond whether they report or not, but into which variables they report. While in practice most agencies report every crime when they report any, they do have the choice to report only a subset of offenses. This is especially true for subsets of larger categories - such as gun assaults, a subset of aggravated assaults, or marijuana possession arrests which is a subset of drug possession arrests. As an example, Figure 1.8 shows the annual number of aggravated assaults with a gun in New York City. In 2003 the New York Police Department stopped reporting this category of offense, resuming only in 2013. They continued to report the broader aggravated assault category, but not any of the subsections of aggravated assaults which say which weapon was used during the assault. Figure 1.8: Monthly reports of gun assaults in New York City, 1960-2022. Given that agencies can join or drop out of the SRS program at will, and report only partial data, it is highly important to carefully examine your data to make sure that there are no issues caused by this. Even when an agency reports SRS data, and even when they report every crime category, they can report fewer than 12 months of data. In some cases they simply report all of their data in December, or report quarterly or semi-annually so some months have zero crimes reported while others count multiple months in that month’s data. One example of this is New York City, shown in Figure 1.9, in the early-2000s to the mid-2010s where they began reporting data quarterly instead of monthly. Figure 1.9: Monthly murders in New York City, 1990-2022. During the 2000s, the police department began reporting quarterly instead of monthly and then resumed monthly reporting. When you sum up each month into an annual count, as shown in Figure 1.10, the problem disappears since the zero months are accounted for in the months that have the quarterly data. If you are using monthly data and only examine the data at the annual level, you will fall into the trap of having incorrect data that is hidden due to the level of aggregation examined. While cases like NYC are obvious when viewed monthly, for people that are including thousands of agencies in their data, it is unfeasible to look at each agency for each crime included. This can introduce errors as the best way to examine the data is manually viewing graphs and the automated method, looking for outliers through some kind of comparison to expected values, can be incorrect. Figure 1.10: Annual murders in New York City, 1990-2022. In other cases when agencies report fewer than 12 months of the year, they simply report partial data and as a result undercount crimes. Figure 1.11 shows annual murders in Miami-Dade, Florida and has three years of this issue occurring. The first two years with this issue are the two where zero murders are reported - this is because the agency did not report any months of data. The final year is in 2018, the last year of data in this graph, where it looks like murder suddenly dropped significantly. That is just because Miami-Dade only reported through June, so they are missing half of 2018. Figure 1.11: Annual murders in Miami-Dade, Florida, 1960-2022. 1.9.3 Zero crimes vs no reports When an agency does not report, we see it in the data as reporting zero crimes, not reporting NA or any indicator that they did not report. In cases where the agency says they did not report that month we can be fairly sure (not entirely since that variable is not always accurate) that the zero crimes reported are simply that the agency did not report. In cases where the agency says they report that month but report zero crimes, we cannot be sure if that is a true no crimes reported to the agency or the agency not reporting to the SRS. As agencies can report some crimes but not others in a given month and still be considered reporting that month, just saying they reported does not mean that the zero is a true zero. In some cases it is easy to see when a zero crimes reported is actually the agency not reporting. As Figure 1.8 shows with New York City gun assaults, there is a massive and sustained drop-off to zero crimes and then a sudden return years later. Obviously, going from hundreds of crimes to zero crimes is not a matter of crimes not occurring anymore, it is a matter of the agency not reporting - and New York City did report other crimes these years so in the data it says that they reported every month. So in agencies which tend to report many crimes - and many here can be a few as 10 a year since going from 10 to 0 is a big drop - a sudden report of zero crimes is probably just non-reporting. Differentiating zero crimes and no reports becomes tricky in agencies that tend to report few crimes, which most small towns do. As an example, Figure 1.12 shows the annual reports of rape in Danville, California, a city of approximately 45,000 people. The city reports on average 2.8 rapes per year and in five years reported zero rapes. In cases like this it is not clear whether we should consider those zero years as true zeros (that no one was raped or reported their rape to the police) or whether the agency simply did not report rape data that year. Figure 1.12: Annual rapes reported in Danville, CA, 1960-2022. 1.9.4 Agency data covered by another agency We will see many examples of when agencies do not follow the definitions, which really limits this data.↩︎ While the original UCR data first reported in 1929, there is only machine-readable data since 1960.↩︎ This is referred to as an “ORI”, “ORI code”, and “ORI number”, all of which mean the same thing.↩︎ The abbreviation for Nebraska is “NB” rather than the more commonly used “NE.”↩︎ For most fixed-width ASCII files there are also missing values where it will have placeholder value such as -8 and the setup file will instruct the software to convert that to NA. SRS data, however, does not have this and does not indicate when values are missing in this manner.↩︎ For those interested in reading in this type of data, please see my R package asciiSetupReader.↩︎ Even highly experienced programmers who are doing something like can make mistakes. For example, if you type out “2+2” 100 times - something extremely simple that anyone can do - how often will you mistype a character and get a wrong result? I would guess that at least once you would make a mistake.↩︎ With the exception of the arrest data and some value label changes in hate crimes and homicide data, the setup files remain consistent so a single file will work for all years for a given dataset. You do not need to make a setup file for each year.↩︎ For evidence of this, please see any of the openICPSR pages for my detail as they detail changes I have made in the data such as decisions on what level to aggregate to and mistakes that I made and later found and fixed.↩︎ Jurisdiction here refers to the boundaries of the local government, not any legal authority for where the officer can make arrests. For example, the Los Angeles Police Department’s jurisdiction in this case refers to crimes that happen inside the city or are otherwise investigated by the LAPD - and are not primarily investigated by another agency.↩︎ Some states do mandate that their agencies report, but this is not always followed.↩︎ "],["about-the-author.html", "About the Author", " About the Author Jacob Kaplan I am a Professional Specialist at the School of Public and International Affairs (SPIA) and a member of Criminal Justice @ SPIA at Princeton University. My research focuses on law enforcement, including its impact on violent crime, the influence of removing ‘bad apple’ officers on reducing complaints against officers, the extent to which police forces represent the civilian populations they serve, and the role of race and political affiliations in shaping officer behavior. In addition to this, I conduct methodological research focused on the quality and usability of crime data, with a special emphasis on the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program.

"],["shr.html", "Chapter 2 Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR) 2.1 Agencies reporting 2.2 Important variables", " Chapter 2 Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR) The Supplementary Homicide Reports dataset - often abbreviated to SHR - is the most detailed of the SRS datasets and provides information about the circumstances and participants (victim and offender demographics and relationship status) for homicides. For each homicide incident it tells you the age, gender, race, and ethnicity of each victim and offender as well as the relationship between the first victim and each of the offenders (but not the other victims in cases where there are multiple victims). It also tells you the weapon used by each offender and the circumstance of the killing, such as a “lovers triangle” or a gang-related murder. As with other SRS data, it also tells you the agency it occurred in and the month and year when the crime happened. One important point of clarification: this is not the number of murders, though it does track that. This data also includes the number of homicides that are manslaughter by negligence (e.g. children playing with a gun, hunting accident) and justifiable homicides (i.e. not criminal). So be carefully when speaking about this data. It is murders but not only murders so you want to speak precisely. 2.1 Agencies reporting This data only has a report when the agency has a homicide that year and since homicides are relatively rare it is difficult to measure underreporting. One way we can look at reporting is to compare homicide in the SHR data with that of other datasets. We will look at two of them: the Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest which is covered in detail in Chapter ??, and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data on national deaths from homicide.12 Both this dataset and the Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest data are SHR datasets so you may think that the numbers of homicides from each dataset should be the same. That is a perfectly reasonable assumption, but since this is SHR data we are talking about, you would be wrong. Police agencies are free to report to either, both, or neither dataset so while the number of homicides are close for each dataset, they are never equal. CDC WONDER data aggregates mortality data (among other data) from state death certificates which reduces the issue of voluntary reporting that we have in SHR data. Figure 2.1 shows the annual number of homicide victims (including murders and manslaughters) from each of these datasets starting in 1976 for the SHR data and in 1999 for the CDC data.13 For the SHR data, in every year the numbers are fairly similar and the trends are the same over time, but the number of homicides is never equal. The numbers have actually gotten worse over time with the difference between the datasets increasing and the Offenses Known data having consistently more murders reported than the SHR data since the late 1990s. Compared to the CDC data, however, both SHR datasets - and in particular the SHR data - undercount the number of homicides. While trends are the same, SHR data reports thousands fewer murders per year than the CDC data, indicating how much of an issue underreporting is in this data. Figure 2.1: The annual number of murders and nonngeligent manslaughters from the Supplementary Homicide Report and the Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest dataset, and homicides from the Center for Disease Control (CDC). Numbers differ because agencies voluntarily report and may not report to both datasets. Let us look at Chicago for another example of the differences in reporting from the SHR and the Offenses Known data. Figure 2.2 shows the annual number of homicide victims from both datasets. In most years they are pretty similar, excluding a few really odd years in the 1980s and in 1990. But what is also strange is that most years have more SHR victims than Offenses Known victims. So nationally SHR has fewer homicides than Offenses Known but that pattern is reversed in Chicago? This is one of the many quirks of SHR data. And is a warning against treating national trends as local trends; what is true nationally is not always true in your community. So when you use this data, check everything closely. And once you have done that, check it again. Figure 2.2: The annual number of homicide victims in Chicago, SHR and Offeksnes Known, 1976-2022. Another way to visualize reporting is to see the total number of agencies that report at least one homicide, as depicted in Figure 2.3. Here we can see that have about 3,000 agencies reporting. Given that most agencies are small and truly do have zero homicides in a year, that may be reasonable. Agencies that do not have homicides do not submit a report saying so, they just do not submit any data. So that makes it hard to tell when an agency not reporting data is doing so because they choose to not report, or because they have nothing to report. This is most common in small agencies where many years truly have no homicides. But let us look at our biggest agencies, and see how much of an impact it would make to have them not report data. Figure 2.3: The annual number of agencies that report at least one homicide. Figures 2.4 and 2.5 attempt to get at this question by looking the number and percent of all incidents that the top 100, 50 and 10 agencies based on number of homicide incidents make up out of all homicide incidents in each year. These agencies are massively disproportionate in how many homicides they represent - though they are also generally the largest cities in the country so are a small number of agencies but a large share of this nation’s population. On average, the 10 agencies with the most homicide incidents each year - which may change every year - have over 4,000 homicide incidents and make up about 1/4 of all homicide incidents reported nationally. The top 50 have about 7,500 incidents a year, accounting for 46% of incidents. The top 100 agencies have a bit under 10,000 incidents a year and make up over 55% of all homicide incidents in the United States. So excluding the largest agencies in the country would certainly undercount homicides. Figure 2.4: The annual number of homicide incidents, showing all agencies, the top 100 agencies (by number of homicide incidents), top 50, and top 10 agencies, 1976-2022. Figure 2.5: The annual percent of homicide incidents by the top 100 agencies (by number of homicide incidents), top 50, and top 10 agencies, 1976-2022. 2.2 Important variables The data has demographic information for up to 11 victims and 11 offenders, as well as the information on the weapon used by each offender, the relationship between the first victim and each offender, and the circumstance of the homicide. The data also has the traditional SHR set of variables about the agency: their ORI code, population, state, region and the month and year of this data. One key variable that is missing is the outcome of the homicide: there is no information on whether any of the offenders were arrested. While there is information on up to 11 victims and offenders, in most cases, there is only a single victim and a single offender in each incident. We can use the additional_victim_count and additional_offender_count columns to see how many additional victims/offenders there are. An additional victim/offender means in addition to the first one. Even though we have columns for up to 11 victims and offenders, in very rare instances the additional_[victim/offender]_count columns may say there are more than 11 victims/offenders. To see how the breakdown for the number of victims in each incident looks, Figure 2.6 shows the percent of incidents with each possible number of victims.14 In nearly all incidents - 96.0% - there was only a single victim. This drops to 3.3% of incidents for two victims, 0.5% for three victims, and only about 0.2% of incidents have four or more victims. Figure 2.6: The percent of incidents that have 1-11 victims. Figure 2.7 shows the breakdown of the number of offenders per homicide incident.15 It is a little less concentrated than with victims but the vast majority of homicides are committed by one offender - or at least the police only report one offender. About 87.6% of homicides have only one offender, 8.4% have two, 2.5% have three, and 1.5% have four. Fewer than 0.5% of homicides have more than four offenders. However, this is all a bit misleading. In cases where there is no information about the offender, including how many offenders there is, the data simply says that there is a single offender. So the number of homicides with a single offender is an over-count while the number with more offenders is an undercount. Figure 2.7: The percent of incidents that have 1-11 offenders. The variable “situation” says what type of victim-offender number combination the incident is - e.g. “multiple victims/single offender”, “single victim/multiple offenders”, etc. - and does indicate if the number of offenders is unknown (though curiously there are over 4,000 instances where the number of offenders is unknown but they still say there are two offenders) so you can use this variable to determine if the police do not know how many offenders there is. You’re still limited, of course, in that the number of offenders is always what the police think there are, and they may be wrong. So use this variable - and anything that comes from it like the percent of offenders of a certain race - with caution. We will now look at a number of important variables individually. Since the data can potentially have 11 victims and 11 offenders - but in practice has only one each in the vast majority of cases - we will only look at the first victim/offender for each of these variables. Therefore, the results will not be entirely accurate, but will still give you a good overview of the data. The figures below will use data for all homicides from 1976 to 2022 so will cover all currently available years of data. Keep in mind that national trends are not the same as local trends so what is shown in these figures will probably not be the same as what is happening in your community. And that looking at all homicides means we are including murders, manslaughters, and justifiable homicides. 2.2.1 Demographics There are two broad categories of variables that we will cover: demographics of the victim and offenders, and characteristics of the case. We start with demographics. 2.2.1.1 Age This data includes the age (in years) for each victim and each offender. For those under one years old, it also breaks this down into those from birth to six days old “including abandoned infant” and those seven days old to 364 days old. So there is a bit more info on homicides of babies. It also maxes out the age at 99 so for victims or offenders older than that we do not get their exact age, just text that says “99 years or older” (which I turn to the number 99 in the figures below). Figure 2.8 shows the percent of homicides where the first offender in the case is of each age from 0-99. Offenders with unknown ages are excluded from this graph and make up about 27% of cases. The average (mean) age is 31.1 years old (shown in orange) which is due to a long right tail; the median age is 28 years old. If you look closely at the left side of the graph you can see that there are some very young offenders, with at least one offender for each year of age from 0 to 10 included in the data. It is not clear from this alone that these ages are a data entry error. While a two-year-old certainly could not kill someone, the data does include deaths caused by “children playing with gun” (homicide circumstances will be discussed in Section 2.2.2.3) so these ages could potentially be correct. If you are familiar with the age-crime curve in criminology - which basically says crime peaks in late teen years then falls dramatically - this shows that exact curve, though is older and does not decline as the offender ages as quickly as we see with less serious crimes. Figure 2.8: The age of homicide offenders, based on the first offender in any homicide incident. Offenders under age 1 (classified as ‘birth to 7 days old, including abandoned infant’ and ‘7 days to 364 days old’) and considered 0 years old. Offenders reported as ‘99 years or older’ are considered 99 years old. Figure 2.9 repeats Figure 2.8 but with victim age rather than offender age. The mean victim age (shown in orange) is 33 and the median age is 30. Though the average victim age is a bit younger than the average offender age, trends are relatively similar for teenagers and older where deaths spikes in the late teen years and then declines steadily. The major difference is the U-shape for younger victims - for victims under age 15, homicides peak at age 0 (i.e. younger than their first birthday) with ~1.4% of all homicides being this this age. They then decline until plateauing at around age 6 before increasing again in the early teen years. Figure 2.9: The age of homicide victims, based on the first victims in any homicide incident. Victims under age 1 (classified as ‘birth to 7 days old, including abandoned infant’ and ‘7 days to 364 days old’) and considered 0 years old. Victims reported as ‘99 years or older’ are considered 99 years old. 2.2.1.2 Sex We will next look at victim and offender sex, a simple variable since only male and female are included. About 62.2% of offenders, as seen in Figure 2.10, are male and about 8.2% are female, indicating a large disparity in the sex of homicide offenders. The remaining 29.6% of offenders do not have sex data available because the police do not know the sex of this individual. For offenders who are not arrested, this variable may be inaccurate since it is perceived sex of the offender.16 Figure 2.10: The sex of offender #1, 1976-2022. There is far less uncertainty for victim sex, with under 0.17% of victims having an unknown sex. Here again there is a large disparity between male and female with about 78.2% of victims being male and 21.6% being female. Figure 2.11: The sex of victim #1, 1976-2022. 2.2.1.3 Race This data also includes the race of the victims and offenders. This includes the following races: American Indian or Alaskan Native, Asian, Black, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and White. These are the only races included in the data; Hispanic is considered an ethnicity and is available as a separate, though flawed, variable. There is no category for bi- or multi-racial. As with other demographics info for offenders, in cases where no arrest is made (and we do not know in this data if one is made), there is no way to confirm the person’s race so these results may not be entirely accurate. Figure 2.12 shows the percent of homicides in the data by the race of offender #1. Black and White offenders are included are similar percentages, at 34.3% and 33.6% of victims, respectively. The next most common group is Unknown at about 30.6% of offenders. Given that so many offenders have an unknown race, the reliability of race measures is limited. The remaining races are Asian at 0.9% of offenders, American Indian or Alaskan Native at 0.6%, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander at 0.02%. Figure 2.12: The race of offender #1, 1976-2022. For victim race, seen in Figure 2.13, only about 1% of victim #1 races are unknown. This means we can be a lot more confident in the race of the victims than in the race of the offender. Similar to offenders, White and Black victims are the two most common races, with 48.4% and 48.1% of victims, respectively. There is a greater share of Asian victims than Asian offenders at 1.5% of victims. American Indian or Alaskan Natives make up 0.8% of victims while Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islanders make up 0.02% of victims. Figure 2.13: The race of victim #1, 1976-2022 2.2.1.4 Ethnicity The final demographic variable is ethnicity which is whether the victim or offender is Hispanic or not Hispanic. The SHR data has a weird relationship with this variable (which is also in the Arrests by Age, Sex, and Race dataset, discussed in Chapter ??) where ethnicity is technically a variable in the data but very rarely collected. As such, this is an unreliable variable that if you really want to use needs careful attention to make sure it is being reported consistently by the agencies that you are looking at. The vast majority - 69.7% - of offenders have an unknown ethnicity while 23.4% are not Hispanic and 7.1% are Hispanic. Figure 2.14: The ethnicity of offender #1, 1976-2022. Unlike the other demographic variables, there is still a huge amount of underreporting when it comes to victim ethnicity, though still less than for offender ethnicity. 55.6% of victims have an unknown ethnicity. Approximately 33.2% of victim #1 are reported as not Hispanic while 11.1% are reported as Hispanic. Figure 2.15: The ethnicity of victim #1, 1976-2022. As an example of agencies under-reporting this variable, let us look at the number of offender #1s in Albuquerque, New Mexico, a city which the US Census says is about 50% Hispanic. Yet the Albuquerque police reported no ethnicity information for almost three decades of data. Figure 2.16: Annual number of offender #1 who is Hispanic in Albuquerque, New Mexico, 1976-2022. 2.2.2 Case characteristics Now we will move to facts about each case such as what weapon was used, how people involved knew each other, and what was the (rough) cause of the homicide. 2.2.2.1 Weapon used The first variable we will look at is the weapon used by each offender. Table 2.1 shows the weapon used by the first offender in every incident from 1976 to 2022. Each offender can only be reported as having a single weapon, so this table essentially shows the number (and percent) of homicides caused by this weapon. This is not entirely true since in reality an offender could use multiple weapons and there can be multiple offenders. In these cases the police include what they believe is the “primary” weapon used by this offender. The most commonly used weapon is a handgun, which is used in nearly half of homicides. This is followed by a knife or other sharp weapon used to cut at almost 15% of homicides, and then by “firearm, type not stated” which is just a firearm where we do not know the exact type (it can include handguns) at 8.9% of homicides The fourth most common weapon is “personal weapons” at nearly 6% of homicides. “Personal weapons” is a weird term to mean that there was no weapon - the “weapon” was the offender who beat the victim to death. Shotguns are involved in almost 5% of homicides and all other weapons are involved in fewer than 5% of cases. In total there are 19 different weapons included though most are very uncommon. Table 2.1: The weapon used in a homicide incident, 1976-2022. In cases where there are multiple offenders, shows only the primary weapon for the first offender. Weapon # of Incidents % of Incidents Handgun 388,178 49.06% Knife Or Cutting Instrument 115,540 14.60% Firearm, Type Not Stated 70,632 8.93% Personal Weapons - Includes Beating 45,473 5.75% Other Or Unknown Weapon 42,002 5.31% Shotgun 36,827 4.65% Blunt Object 34,716 4.39% Rifle 28,108 3.55% Strangulation - Includes Hanging 9,763 1.23% Fire 5,380 0.68% Asphyxiation - Includes Death By Gas 4,804 0.61% Other Gun 3,473 0.44% Narcotics/Drugs - Includes Sleeping Pills 3,144 0.40% Drowning 1,387 0.18% Other Or Type Unknown 586 0.07% Poison - Does Not Include Gas 531 0.07% Explosives 386 0.05% Pushed Or Thrown Out of Window 257 0.03% Narcotics Or Drugs 48 0.01% Total 791,235 100% You may have noticed from the table that AR-15 is not included. While AR-15 is the commonly discussed in the media and policy circles as a way to control gun violence, it is not in a category by itself. Instead it is combined with other rifles in the “rifle” weapon group, and makes up about 3.6% of the weapons used by offender #1 in the data. Let us check if AR-15s, through our rough proxy of the “rifle” weapon group, is getting more common over time. Figure 2.17 shows the number of homicide incidents (including manslaughters, so not necessarily all murders) where offender #1 used a rifle. Figure 2.18 shows the percent of all homicide incidents where the the weapon was a rifle. Using both of these measures we can see the rifles are getting less common, declining substantially since 1980 though increasing again starting in the mid-2010s. Figure 2.17: The annual number of homicide incidents where offender #1’s weapon was a rifle, 1976-2022. Figure 2.18: The annual share of homicide incidents where offender #1’s weapon was a rifle, 1976-2022. Now, maybe this weapon is more commonly used in some types of crimes such as school shootings. You could get at that question using this data by seeing if times when a rifle is used that victims or offenders are younger or if the circumstance is something that suggests a school shooting. Unfortunately there is no offense location variable here, though there is in NIBRS and we can largely recreate this data through NIBRS. And of course you cannot tell if the weapon is actually an AR-15, only if it is a rifle. 2.2.2.2 Relationship between first victim and offenders An interesting and highly useful variable is the relationship between the first victim and each offender. To be clear, this is only for the first victim; we do not have the relationship between other victims and offenders. However, as seen earlier, this is not too much of an issue since nearly all incidents only have a single victim. There are 29 possible relationship types (including “unknown” relationship) which are broken into three categories: legal family members, people known to the victim but who are not family, and people not known to the victim. Table 2.2 shows these relationships and the number and percent of homicides with these relationships. The most common relationship, with about 28% of homicides, is that the police do not know the relationship. So there is a good deal of uncertainty in the relationship between victims and offenders. Next is that the victim is the offender’s acquaintance at 19.7% or is a stranger at 15.3%. The next is “other - known to victim” which is similar to being an acquaintance at almost 5% of homicides. This is followed by the victim being the friend of the murderer at 3.6%. The 6th most common relationship, at 3.6% is that the victim is the wife of the offender, so she is murdered by her husband, and is the first familial relationship of this list. The remaining relationships all make up fewer than 3% of all homicides. Table 2.2: The relationship between the first victim and the first offender in a homicide incident, 1976-2022. Relationship Category # of Incidents % of Incidents Unknown 296,757 37.51% Acquaintance Not family (but known) 156,115 19.73% Stranger Not known 120,719 15.26% Other - Known To Victim Not family (but known) 37,899 4.79% Friend Not family (but known) 28,411 3.59% Wife Family 27,977 3.54% Girlfriend Not family (but known) 21,447 2.71% Husband Family 12,085 1.53% Other Family Family 11,760 1.49% Son Family 11,408 1.44% Boyfriend Not family (but known) 10,009 1.26% Neighbor Not family (but known) 8,081 1.02% Daughter Family 8,056 1.02% Brother Family 6,961 0.88% Father Family 5,667 0.72% Mother Family 5,274 0.67% In-Law Family 4,608 0.58% Common-Law Wife Family 3,317 0.42% Common-Law Husband Family 2,722 0.34% Ex-Wife Not family (but known) 2,365 0.30% Stepfather Family 1,864 0.24% Homosexual Relationship Not family (but known) 1,704 0.22% Sister Family 1,536 0.19% Stepson Family 1,500 0.19% Ex-Husband Not family (but known) 937 0.12% Stepdaughter Family 792 0.10% Employer Not family (but known) 564 0.07% Employee Not family (but known) 451 0.06% Stepmother Family 250 0.03% Total 791,236 100% 2.2.2.3 Homicide circumstance We also have information on the type of the homicide, which this data calls the “circumstance.” This comes as relatively broad categories that leave a lot to be desired in our understanding of what led to the homicide. Table 2.3 shows the number and percent of each circumstance for the first victim of each homicide from 1976 to 2022. This data has 33 possible circumstances which it groups into four main categories: murders that coincide with committing another crime (“felony type” murders), murders that do not coincide with another crime (“non-felony type” murders), justifiable homicides, and negligent manslaughter. The felony type murders are simply ones where another crime occurred during the homicide. While this is called “felony type” it does include other crimes such as theft and gambling (which are not always a felony) so is a bit of a misnomer. The “non-felony type” are murders that happen without another crime. This includes gang killings (where, supposedly, only the murder occurred), children killed by babysitters, fights among intoxicated (both of alcohol and drugs) people, and “lover’s triangle” killings. Justifiable homicides are when a person (civilian or police officer) kill a person who is committing a crime. Negligent manslaughter includes accidental shootings such as when children find and shoot a gun, but excludes deaths from traffic accidents. The most common circumstances, accounting for 27.4%, 26.9%, and 12.5%, respectively, are “Unknown”, “Other Arguments”, and “Other Non-Felony Type - Not Specified.” Since the data includes “Argument Over Money Or Property” as one category, the “Other Arguments” mean that it is an argument for a reason other than over money or property. The “Other Non-Felony Type” one does not mean that the murder did not occur alongside another crime, but also does not fall into the non-felony categories included. Robbery is the only remaining circumstance with more than 5% of murders, at 7.4%. Table 2.3: The circumstance of the homicide for the first offender in a homicide incident. Circumstance Category # of Incidents % of Incidents Unknown 219,450 27.74% Other Arguments Non-Felony Type 212,941 26.91% Other Non-Felony Type - Not Specified Non-Felony Type 98,730 12.48% Robbery Felony Type 58,885 7.44% Narcotic Drug Laws Felony Type 28,360 3.58% Juvenile Gang Killings Non-Felony Type 24,309 3.07% Felon Killed By Police Justifiable Homicide 17,553 2.22% Other Felony Type - Not Specified Felony Type 15,460 1.95% Brawl Due To Influence of Alcohol Non-Felony Type 15,227 1.92% Argument Over Money Or Property Non-Felony Type 14,972 1.89% Felon Killed By Private Citizen Justifiable Homicide 13,928 1.76% All Suspected Felony Type Felony Type 12,975 1.64% All Other Manslaughter By Negligence Except Traffic Deaths Negligent Manslaughter 8,536 1.08% Domestic Violence (Historically Called Lovers Triangle/Quarrel) 6,431 0.81% Burglary Felony Type 6,356 0.80% Gangland Killings Non-Felony Type 5,809 0.73% Brawl Due To Influence of Narcotics Non-Felony Type 4,750 0.60% Lovers Triangle Non-Felony Type 4,158 0.53% Rape Felony Type 4,142 0.52% Other Negligent Handling of Gun Which Resulted In Death of Another Negligent Manslaughter 3,877 0.49% Arson Felony Type 3,304 0.42% Motor Vehicle Theft Felony Type 1,468 0.19% Children Playing With Gun Negligent Manslaughter 1,453 0.18% Other Sex Offenses Felony Type 1,433 0.18% Child Killed By Babysitter Non-Felony Type 1,342 0.17% Institutional Killings Non-Felony Type 1,262 0.16% Gambling Felony Type 1,040 0.13% Larceny Felony Type 916 0.12% Prostitution And Commercialized Vice Felony Type 626 0.08% Other - Not Specified Felony Type 554 0.07% Sniper Attack Non-Felony Type 480 0.06% Victim Shot In Hunting Accident Negligent Manslaughter 350 0.04% Gun Cleaning Death - Other Than Self-Inflicted Negligent Manslaughter 144 0.02% Abortion Felony Type 14 0.00% Human Trafficking/Commercial Sex Acts 1 0.00% Total 791,236 100% 2.2.2.4 Homicide subcircumstance The “subcircumstance” just tells you more information about justifiable homicides. This includes the circumstance leading up to the “felon” - which is how the person killed is described, though technically they do not need to have committed a felony - was killed. It includes if this person attacked an officer (the one who killed them), a different officer, a civilian, or was committing or fleeing a crime. This dataset is one source of information on how many people police kill each year. But it is a large undercount compared to other sources such as the Washington Post collection, so is not a very useful source of information on this topic. Table 2.4: The circumstance for the first offender in a homicide incident in cases where the offender is killed. This includes incidents where the only person who dies in the offender. Subcircumstance # of Incidents % of Incidents Felon Killed In Commission of A Crime 11,026 35.02% Felon Attacked Police Officer 9,224 29.30% Felon Attacked A Civilian 5,499 17.47% Not Enough Information To Determine 2,529 8.03% Felon Resisted Arrest 1,268 4.03% Felon Attacked Fellow Police Officer 1,096 3.48% Felon Attempted Flight From A Crime 840 2.67% Total 31,482 100% CDC WONDER data is available here: https://wonder.cdc.gov/↩︎ 1975 is actually the first year that the Supplementary Homicide Reports data is available but that dataset only has info for a single victim and offender - all later years has info for up to 11 victims and offenders - so 1976 is often used as the first year of data↩︎ There are five incident where there are more than 11 victims. For simplicity of the graph, these incident are excluded.↩︎ There are seven incidents with more than 11 offenders. For simplicity of the graph, these incidents are excluded.↩︎ If we ignore unknown sex, essentially saying that the unknown people will have their sex distributed exactly as the known sex people, 88% are male and 12% are female. However, this assumption is probably wrong since the unknown people may be materially different than the known people, as evidence by them likely not being arrested and committing the crime in a way where even their sex cannot be identified. ↩︎ "],["arsonChapter.html", "Chapter 3 Arson 3.1 Agencies reporting 3.2 Important variables 3.3 Data errors", " Chapter 3 Arson The arson dataset provides monthly counts for arsons that occur, and includes a breakdown of arsons by the type of arson (e.g. arson of a person’s home, arson of a vehicle, arson of a community/public building) and the estimated value of the damage caused by the arson. The first year we have arson data is 1979. This data includes all arsons reported to the police or otherwise known to the police such as when an officer discovers it while on patrol. It also has a count of arsons that lead to an arrest (of at least one person who committed the arson) and of reports that turned out to not be arsons, such as if an investigation found that the fire was started accidentally. This is essentially the Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest data, detailed in Chapter ??, but for arsons. The data even follows the same definitions for categories such as what counts as a cleared or unfounded crime. The primary additional variable is the estimated damage in dollars caused by the arson. As much of this information is the same as detailed in Chapter ??, this chapter will be brief. If you have a question about definitions, please refer to that chapter. For the arson categories where a building was burned the data includes the number of arsons where the structure was uninhabited or otherwise not in use, so you can estimate the percent of arsons of buildings that had the potential to harm people. This measure is for structures where people normally did not inhabit the structure - such as a vacant building where no one lives. A home where no one is home at the time of the arson does not count as an uninhabited building. In cases where the arson led to a death, that death would be recorded as a murder on the Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest dataset - but not indicated anywhere on this dataset. If an individual who responds to the arson dies because of it, such as a police officer or a firefighter, this is not considered a homicide (though the officer death is still included in the Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted data) unless the arsonist intended to cause their deaths. 3.1 Agencies reporting This dataset measures how many months that an agency reports data over a year in the same way as the Offenses Known data does: the standard FBI definition using the last month reported, and my own measure counting how many months reported data according to a column for each month that says so.17 And just like the Offenses Known data, the variable I use for my own measurement changed in 2018, leading to fewer months of data reported and making it non-comparable to pre-2018 data. The variable changed again in 2021 and said that all agencies always reported data in every month, making the variable useless. In Figure 3.1 we can see the annual number of agencies that reported at least one month of data using both measures. These measures are nearly identical every year with the last month reported having slightly more agencies reported, but they are effectively the same. This changes in 2018 as my measure declines considerably and then skyrockets to nearly 25,000 agencies in 2021 and 2022. The last month reported variable declines considerably in 2021, consistent with the FBI ending SRS collection, and then rebounds in 2022 when the FBI reopens SRS collection. How can there be more than 18k agencies reporting? The 18k number is the estimated number of agencies that are active: agencies that can respond to crimes and do investigations. Remember that SRS data goes back decades - the Offenses Known data is available since 1930. So agencies can come and go, with agencies shutting down or joining with other agencies. Over time this adds up to thousands of agencies other than the 18k we normal think about. Figure 3.1: The annual number of police agencies that report at least month of data, using both measures of how many months are reported, 1979-2022. In Figure ?? we can see the same graph as before but now for agencies reporting 12 months of data that year. The trends in both measures are the same, at least until 2018, with the last month reported measure always being a bit higher than the number of months missing measure. Which measure is better to use? In general I would say my own measure but obviously that does not work starting in 2018. In practice both measures are quite similar so the decision on which to use depends on your own use-case such as if you are looking at data after 2017. 3.2 Important variables Similar to the Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest data, this data shows the monthly number of crimes - in this case only arsons - reported or discovered by the police, the number found by police to be unfounded, and the number cleared by the police. In addition, it includes the number of arsons in structures that were uninhabited, and the estimated cost of the damage caused by the arsons. For each variable, the arsons are also broken into several categories of arsons, which we will talk about in Section 3.2.1. Like other SRS datasets, there are also variables that provide information about the agency - ORI codes, population under jurisdiction - the month and year that the data covers, and how many months reported data. When another agency submits data for the given agency, that is noted in the data through the “covered_by_ori” variable. 3.2.1 Types of arsons For each of the outcome categories detailed below, this dataset has information for ten different types of arson. There are seven arsons types for buildings, two for vehicles, and one as an “other” category that includes arsons of outdoor areas like parks or forests. For both the buildings and the vehicle arson types there is also a “total buildings” and “total vehicles” category that is just the sum of each subcategory; there is also a “grand total” variable that sums all building, vehicle, and other arsons. For each of the building arsons we also have variables that say how many of the arsons were of uninhabited buildings. Total structures (buildings) Single occupancy (e.g. single family homes) Other residential (e.g. hotel, apartment) Storage (warehouses, storage facilities) Industrial Other commercial (e.g. restaurant, office building, car dealership) Community/public (e.g. government buildings, hospitals, community centers, places of worship) All other structures (all buildings that do not fit in another category’) Total mobile vehicles (vehicles) Motor vehicles (a car that runs on a road such as a SUV, sedan, motorcycle) Other mobile vehicles (other mobile objects such as airplanes and boats) Other (everything that does not fit in a previous category) Grand total (all arsons of any category) Some arsons can burn down multiple types or structures or cars - fire, after all, tends to spread. This data defines the arson based on where the fire originated, regardless of what burns after that. This is true even if the damage is more severe for a type other than where the fire started. For example, a recent fire in California was started by a man “pushing a burning car into a ravine.” That fire, known as the Park Fire has burned over 429,000 acres and over 700 buildings. This fire would be classified as a motor vehicle arson because the fire started in a vehicle. 3.2.2 Actual arsons This variable includes the number of arsons either reported to the police or otherwise known to the police in that month and that the police determine to actually be arsons - that is, reports that are not unfounded. This is the number of arsons, regardless of their severity. An arson that burns down a single vehicle is treated as one arson, as is an arson that burns down a vehicle, 429 thousand acres of land, and 600 buildings. 3.2.3 Unfounded arsons This variable shows the number of arsons reports that the police determined to not actually be arsons. For example, if a house burns down and police think it was arson but later determine that it was an accident, it would be an unfounded arson. Whether an arson is unfounded is based only on the police’s determination about that event, not the decision of other groups like a court or the conviction of someone for the crime. However, this doesn’t mean that the officer makes that decision in a vacuum as they can use evidence such as the findings from firefighters for if the fire was an arson. 3.2.4 Reported arsons This variable is the sum of actual arsons and unfounded arsons - it is the total number of arsons that were reported or known to the police, even if a later investigation found that it was not actually an arson. 3.2.5 Cleared arsons This shows the number of arsons where at least one offender is arrested or when an arrest cannot be made for some reason, but the police know who the offender is - the latter option is called “exceptional clearances” or “clearances by exceptional means.” There is no way to tell if a clearance is due to an arrest or due to exceptional means.18 Please note that this data is at the incident-level which means that having multiple people arrested for an incident still only is a clearance for that single incident. If there are multiple people who committed the arson only one needs to be arrested or exceptionally cleared for the incident to be cleared. Clearances are reported in the month they occur, which may be different than the month when the arson happened. This can create the illusion that more crimes are solved than were reported in certain time periods. Figure 3.2, for example, shows the number of actual arsons (reports that are founded) and clearances for single-family home arsons in League City, Texas, a city of about 100,000 outside of Houston. In most years there were fewer clearances than arsons, but in four years (1982, 1981, 1992, and 2007) there were more clearances than arsons. Figure 3.2: The annual number of single-family home arsons and clearances in League City, Texas, 1979-2022. 3.2.6 Cleared for arsons where all offenders are under age 18 This variable is the same for normal clearances but only for arsons where every offender is under the age of 18. For juvenile offenders, a clearance can still occur if the juvenile is issued a citation to appear in court, even if they are not formally arrested and taken into custody. As this variable requires that the police know the identity of every offender (to be able to determine that they are all under 18), it is likely flawed and merits caution when using. 3.2.7 Uninhabited building arsons This data also includes the number of arsons that occur in uninhabited structures. These structures must be uninhabited in the long-term, not simply having no one inside them when the arson occurs. In the FBI’s manual for this data they define uninhabited buildings as ones that are “uninhabited, abandoned, deserted, or not normally in use” at the time of the arson. For example, a vacation home whose owners are not living in at the time would be “not normally in use” so would be an uninhabited building. A business that is closed when the fire started, but is open during the day, is not an uninhabited building. 3.2.8 Estimated damage cost The final variable is the estimated cost of the arson. This is how much the police estimates the value (in dollars) of the damaged or destroyed property is. Since this is the value of property damage, injuries to people (including non-physical injuries such as trauma or mental health costs) are not included. Since this is estimated damage it may be inaccurate to some degree. This variable is the sum of monthly estimated cost so while you can get the average cost by dividing this by the number of actual offenses, this average may be significantly off due to having extremely small or large values in your data. This value may be $0 since arsons include attempted arsons which may cause little or no damage. Please note that this value is not inflation-adjusted so you will have to adjust the value yourself. 3.3 Data errors Like the other SRS data, there are some cases where there are obvious data entry errors leading to impossible numbers of reported arsons or to the price of an arson. As an example, Figure 3.3 shows the annual number of single-family home arsons in Byron City, Illinois, which has a population of slightly over 3,600 people. In every year there are zero arsons reported until 2003 when 469 arsons are reported. Since it is exceedingly unlikely that suddenly an eighth of the city each suffered different arson attacks, and that the city never again had a residence arson, this is almost certainly a data entry error. As arsons are relatively rare, having errors - and especially ones like this - can drastically change the results of your analysis so it is important to check your data carefully for more errors. Figure 3.3: Annual single-family home arsons in Byron City, Illinois. The sudden spike to over 400 arsons in a single year is an example of data errors in this dataset, 1979-2022. There are also cases where it is less clear when a value is a data error or is simply due to an outlier - but real - value. For example, Figure 3.4 shows the annual average cost of a single-family home fire in Los Angeles, California. In most years the value is low. Since an arson can cause little or no damage, these low values likely mean that on average only part of the house was damaged, rather than the entire house burning down. In 2009, however, the average damage is about $540,000 per arson. Is this a data entry error that simply inputs a damage value that is too high? It certainly appears to be a data error since it is a sudden huge jump in damage value. However, it could also be that some extraordinarily expensive homes were destroyed that year. In 2009, Los Angeles reported only 63 single-family home arsons so having one, or a few, super mansions - which LA has plenty of - destroyed could mean that this huge value is real. Figure 3.4: The annual cost per arson for single family homes in Los Angeles, California, 1979-2022. This is different than identifying how many months have an arson as there may be months that truly do not have any arsons. We do not want to count those are non-reporting months.↩︎ NIBRS data does tell more information about the type of arrest, but SRS data does not↩︎ "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
